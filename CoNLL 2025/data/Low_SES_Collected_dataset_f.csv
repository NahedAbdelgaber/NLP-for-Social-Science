0,"I think I'm probably late to the party, but I'll share my story anyway.
I've never talked about this part of my life with anyone really, so this is a big step for me.

My mum had me at 15yo. No idea who my dad is. I grew up with a single mum who would spend every last dollar on meth or coke. To say we were poor was an understatement. No amount of government assistance can get through to you if you mother is an addict. We moved around a lot (I went to 17 different schools growing up), having no food was a common occurrence. I've been homeless for periods of time as a kid. I've had to wash myself in public restrooms and from time to time I was sent to other 'relatives' to live. I was sexually abused on multiple occasions and I've kept all of this to myself all these years. When you're a kid it's terrifying to speak out. You already live in a shaky, unstable world so uprooting the last foundation you have (even if it's a drug addled mother) is unthinkable.

Anyway, fast-forward. I tried really hard in school. I mean really hard. It was the only way I could see myself getting out of the hole I was in. My mum dropped out of school at 14 and all I knew is that I never wanted to end up like her. I got a job the day of my 15th birthday (which in my country is the legal age you can start working) and to this day (I'm 27yo) I've not spent a day unemployed. I worked and saved as much as I could and when mum told me she was moving again when I was 16 I said no and moved out on my own. I was tired of starting over. I applied for emancipation and moved into a flat— I've seen her a handful of times since, I'm not even sure where she lives anymore.

I went to university, kept up a 4.0 GPA while working near full-time and graduated with first class honours. I don't say this to brag. I sacrificed a lot to pull this off. I trashed my social life, never went on a holiday and ignored parts of my health because I wasn't a prodigy or anything close to it, I just fucking grinded my face off. I got a job in my field, got a post degree qualification, and in the last couple of years I've started clearing $100k+ per year.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}",No struggles found,,0
1,"Hi all, I'll try to keep this as short as possible but my situation is complicated so I'll do what I can. I'll put it into bullet points so hopefully that will help. I'm 29 years old and have been going to college on and off since I graduated high school in 2009. I wanted to take time off before I started college to figure out exactly what I wanted to do. However, I had to attend in order to keep living with my sister so I essentially had no choice but to go. I started at a local community college and have gone there on and off since starting. In between those times, I went to various four years schools which were mostly online. I'm one credit away from an associates here but it is a class that can only be taken on campus and I live 2 states away now. Pretty much all of my early 20s had been all over the place which lead to issues attending college and doing the work. There were times when I couldn't get to class because I didn't have enough money for gas and nobody to bring me so I had to drop out. I lost my job at one point and had to drop out from one of the online schools during the first week to start my job hunt. I was engaged and when that broke off I had to withdraw again because I had to find somewhere to live and figure out my next steps. I have multiple chronic health issues that would flair up and I ended having to withdraw for certain semesters due to that. I also had untreated and undiagnosed ADHD which only exacerbated things more. There were also times where I would withdraw from online classes and schools entirely because I didn't end up doing well in their classroom structure/it wasn't for me. Since that first time I've had to drop a few more times and took a decent period of time off afterward to figure everything out. Once I was in a good spot, I attempted to go back last year (2019) and was asked again to do verification. No problem, unfortunately the issues I had don't really have documentation or I have no access to them. How do you document a diagnosis that you didn't have at the time? How do you document a relationship ending? My employer that let me go no longer has on file that I was ever an employee there because they didn't hold on to the record. Basically, I'm in a position where I can't prove anything and it is my word only. The school essentially told me that was the end of the road. One of the previous schools won't release an official transcript to me because I owe them money. Even after trying to set up a payment arrangement that would have probably put me in the poorhouse they wouldn't release it. The school mentioned in the previous bullet ended up waiving it for me and took a grade report instead. I was still technically enrolled but not attending classes at another school that I did really enjoy but didn't offer my specific major. I chose to go back there to get some transfer courses done and wait things out for the unusual enrollment. Well, after getting myself reinstated with them and going through a SAP appeal from my previous term, I found out I was close to hitting my aggregate student loan cap. Due to this they were reducing my per term financial aid to a point where I was going to need to pay $500 out of pocket every 10 weeks in order to attend school for the next year or two. That is not feasible for me so I ended up calling it quits. I've since been making payments on my student loans using income driven repayment since September 2019. I need help and I'm not sure where to get it. I can't get help from a school without applying and I'm not going to waste my time and the admissions department's time if I can't attend in the first place. Is there any agency or person/type of person that can help me navigate this? I've tried myself but there are way too many moving parts for me to understand. I don't know where to turn to get the final answer about my situation.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['issues attending college and doing the work', 'lost job', 'broke off engagement', 'had to withdraw due to chronic health issues', 'untreated and undiagnosed ADHD', ""documenting a diagnosis that I didn't have at the time"", 'documenting a relationship ending', 'employer that let me go no longer has on file that I was ever an employee there', ""can't prove anything and it is my word only"", 'school essentially told me that was the end of the road', ""previous school won't release an official transcript to me because I owe them money"", 'found out I was close to hitting my aggregate student loan cap', 'reducing my per term financial aid to a point where I was going to need to pay $500 out of pocket every 10 weeks in order to attend school for the next year or two', ""cannot get help from a school without applying and I'm not going to waste my time and the admissions department's time if I can't attend in the first place""]",,0
2,"This is personal but idc. I’m lucky to be poor, and also a bit of a workaholic loner type. Not to say I can’t be outgoing, enjoy myself at a party, poke fun at stuff, give people shit back when they give me shit in a non aggressive way (basically I’m a loner but not antisocial) , etc.
But idk it’s like give me a deck I’ll say fuck it and play. Life goes on. The game ain’t over. Yada yada.
If I need the money I just shut tf up and don’t party. Happens more often than not. I don’t go out to eat and cook for myself. I spend money on ways to get out of the house to forget for a bit how poor I am, hopefully stay in good enough shape to be able to live life a little when I’m at the age where I have time. Then it just kinda clicked and I became a fitness dude.
Home life was also pretty fucking awful so you can imagine why I’d be so inclined to get out of the house. Did I mention that’s also why I’m poor?
Mom does crack and my dad went to prison for stealing a roof. More lokey he vandalized a roof and stole the evidence but eh. He’s doing better now but him coming back into my life is absolutely fucking with my already close cut financial aid cuz he brings in decent money. Not enough to pay for my college but enough for the IRS to fuck me over on finances.
Stfu, go work out, do my school work, work. Also wierd cuz I never really had friends come to my house growing up for that reason. Then in college im in a dorm so it was like woaaaah, I can do that now. Huh.
Basically I work out and work cuz it’s cheaper than partying. My loner lifestyle lokey made me indifferent to any of that stuff. Just kinda fell into the motions that I guess indirectly save me money.
Only reason I even said any of this is cuz I gotta copy paste pretty much this in any scholarship essay I write. No shame in it, not in my control. Also yeah I write a lot of those cuz Federal aid as we know ain’t gonna be reliable pretty soon with all these budget cuts hahaha also fuck you HESC.

3,"Back in the time I was going to school, I was always among the poorest kids in the class, nearly no one wants to make friends with me cos I didn’t have any money (actually my family didn’t) and I didn’t have nice clothes to wear so they would feel embarrassed when hanging out with a friend like me. Even my relatives, they looked my family down and underestimated me and my sister a lot since we were not as wealthy as them. So I decided to try my best to bring up my family, so my parents could be proud of me and my sister can have someone to follow the footsteps. Then I got good results in college and have quite a good job in a big city (300km away from my hometown) and support my family finance (not much but still good), after that, whenever I come home, my relatives never have the same attitude to me n family as the old time anymore.

I work 20 hours at X to pay everything you can think of. I have to support my family, mostly in paying school fees and some other necessities that my siblings need- I am the first born, first to attend college, so they all look up to me. Money to me is the only thing that matters, I consider it my main limitation. I'm always very nervous when dealing with money and looking at my bank account balances is a source of stress so I avoid it as much as I can. As a CS major I always feel like I am left behind because I couldn't access most of electronics and other resources my classmates grew up with and still can't. In any case, I have actually never felt poor, more so because in most cases X got me covered, well beside student loans waiting for me after graduation.","{'background': ['My single mother is unemployed, barely makes enough to feed a family of four.']}",No struggles found,,0
5,"Used Pell grants and state need grants to cover community college. Then got a work study job at my community college to build experience and cover remaining tuition expenses. After graduating from community with an associates, was able to get an entry level IT job. Paid for my bachelors tuition in cash from my job, taking night and weekend classes to fit around work. With the bachelors and the experience was able to get better and better jobs over time. 17 years from starting and am a manager in the cyber security industry, making over 200k.

6,"I'm still new to this upper middle class thing. I was born to two drug addicts. We lived in a van for a while when I was 4 years old. I was adopted by a couple who were getting ready to retire. They did not originally intend to adopt but my dad was out of the picture and my mom died young. They raised 5 kids on a low level utility employee's salary. my first year as an xray tech I made 30% more than my adoptive parents did the last year before retirement. we grew up learning to stretch every dollar. I qualified for every free lunch program and for financial aid grants.


The things that helped me bridge the gap were the people who rooted for me. I remember being really young and thinking that I would work construction or be a mechanic, because ""that's what people like me did for a living."" The biggest barrier between me and success was the low expectations everyone had for me. I was a brown dot in a sea of white. I was that poor adopted kid. I had brothers that were always in trouble, and a parents that weren't able to get it together to take care of me.


No one ever said anything directly, no one said I couldn't be a doctor, or an engineer, but it was implied. There was also a lot of condescending humor from people when I did have a small success. ""Oh, you did well in the spelling bee, great for you. sometimes you get lucky on the word lineup, Maybe some day you'll so something worth while."" It hurt, and they thought that just because I was a kid that I wouldn't understand. Around age 12, shortly after my mom died, I realized that it didn't matter what people thought of me or said about me, I was smart enough and determined enough to do whatever I wanted in life.


initially few people saw my potential, those who did, showed genuine interest, gave sound advice, and trusted me to work it all out by myself. Those that doubted always tried to find ""something less challenging"" or almost as good for me. They made planned my life out based on what they thought I was capable of, and it wasn't much.


I clawed and scraped my way through college, I worked full time because I missed out on grant money because my university made a mistake on my transcript and refused to correct it. I changed schools 4 times to get all the pre-requisite classes done in 1.5 years instead of 2. I got an angry letter from the deans office my last semester because I took 24 credits while working 45 hours/week to finish undergrad. I studied during my breaks at work to get ready for PA school I worked 18 hour shifts to pay for my undergrad. I was relentless, and I couldn't have done it without my people.


The ones that saw what I could do, knew that the best thing to do was to take down barriers, and the rest would fall into place. A family friend payed for my CNA certificate. A well-respected doctor took me under his wing and helped me make some of my decisions about work and school. My friends parents were genuinely happy for me and encouraging with every achievement. My best friend showed up to every award ceremony, and graduation. My adoptive mother allowed me to stay at home for undergrad rent free. My boss made arrangements with my schedule to allow for full time work, and school. Various friends offered couches, meals, and a listening ear for when I had projects due, or workshops to attend. Even my nephews offered time for me to teach them anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology even though they didn't have any idea what any of it meant.


The big difference now, is that I am amazed at the change in value I have at the company I work for. Before graduate school, I was expendable. Now that I am making good money for the company, They give me free meals, clothes, bonuses, and all kinds of perks. It still feels like I'm stealing every time I leave cafeteria without pulling out my wallet. I feel like a celebrity, and I don't like it.


TLDR. The realization that I didn't have to follow people's expectations was pivotal. Also I had a great team of people cheering me on and tying up loose ends.

7,I grew up dirt poor and lived in a family of 5 with a household income of about $20k until last December when I moved in with my Dad in a household of 2 with a very comfortable income. Being poor fucking blows. All my friends got to vacation when the only times I would leave the state were to see family maybe once every few years. We were on state insurance and food stamps and every government assistance program you could find. They were helpful but limiting. My friends used to get angry with me because I couldn't afford to do things with them ever. And seconded on literally all of your points but especially the one about having people over- my friends lived in nice homes when I lived in a trailer. I was always so scared people were going to talk shit about me. And the stress. Being poor fucking sucks.

I don't spend a lot though.

My high school was decent and I came in with a bit of AP credit (which my HS principal subsidized) but for my whole freshman yeah I felt light-years behind my peers. My high school did not have a physics course at all, and when I went into Physics 7A I felt like I was the only one who didn't already know the material. I had to borrow books from friends or do problem sets in the library because there was no way I was buying them. Pretty much everyone was relatively well off, and I felt deeply misplaced. It was ass.
However, after a year or so a funny thing happened. X kicked the living shit out of all of us. We all took the same exams, joined many of the same groups (Pi Tau Sigma represent! ), went to football games for free, made mistakes, and met challenges together. It didn't take long for many of those differences to go away.
It's not always easy to make friends in college, especially if you feel like you're just so unlike everyone else. Trust me though, you will find kindred spirits, and really it only takes a couple. Just remember that even the most confident people, with all the privilege and preparation in the world, are still teenagers trying to figure out who the hell they are. Hell, one of my best friends had millionaire parents and went to an SAT prep school, and yet all the food in his fridge was expired and he had no clue how to do his damn laundry. No one is perfect; don't let the veneer fool you.
TL;DR: It sucks now, but it does get better. And then much better. And eventually one of the best experiences of your life. Make those grades and make those friends and it will pay dividends for life.","{'background': [""I came from a very poor household (10-15k is a year) and from a relatively poor part of California's central valley."", 'My family could never afford', 'I, however, am poor']}","['felt light-years behind my peers', 'had to borrow books from friends or do problem sets in the library because there was no way I was buying them', 'It was ass', ""didn't take long for many of those differences to go away"", 'make those grades and make those friends and it will pay dividends for life']",,0

21,"Thanks to government programs we weren't homeless or starving. Just house insecure and hungry.

I got very lucky in attending a small private college. Would have been lost in a big university. Because it was private, they had some money from rich people and could give me some extra money just because. I think I might have been an affirmative action type candidate. I was from the coast and the college was in the Midwest. They also required us to live in dorms and eat their food at the cafeteria so my housing and food needs were met.

I had some difficulty getting started after college. So the next 4 years were tough. It was the recession of the early 80's, no internet, and I had no job hunting knowledge. Pre-internet was rough in terms of getting career and job knowledge, especially in rural areas. I did find crappy jobs.

Went back to the local community college for accounting courses because at the time all the papers were screaming that we needed eleventy billion accountants right now. I figured, okay, I have to be able to succeed. HATED the classes. Accounting is not my thing. However, the classes qualified me to get a job in government, and was able to make my way up and eventually get into IT. More IT classes as well as self learning and I ended my career in IT.

I don't know if it's a big surprise, but I still drag the stink and shame of poverty to this day. Obviously not all the time, but at least a few times a year I'll lose sleep or shed a tear or otherwise have a strong emotion from the privation.

Looking back I wish I'd gotten counseling sooner, more job counseling throughout my career, and maybe taken some bigger risks. More job hopping, leaving one particular crappy job sooner. On the other hand, the thought of being unemployed and starving in the gutter was way too scary.

I do take comfort in how far I came, and that I was good at my jobs.","{'background': [""Thanks to government programs we weren't homeless or starving. Just house insecure and hungry.""]}",No struggles found,,0

23,"I have attended three semesters of college as a degree-seeking student. I didn't fuss about it, but near the end of the semester, my family got an eviction notice that freaked me out like crazy, as my step-dad wasn't paying rent and was misusing our money. I was already struggling as these last few years of my life have been insane, but we were able to survive. Around that time my Mom and step-dad started their separation/divorce. It left me frazzled at the end of the semester, and I ended up getting an A, C, and D. Not terrible, but I got an academic warning. I told myself it was just me being lazy, and that the next semester I would do better. Then, spring semester of 2017 came and life got insane again, even more so this time. My grandfather committed suicide by shooting himself in the face during spring break, my step-father attempted suicide multiple times from the beginning to end of the semester, my brother got put into inpatient treatment for suicidal activity, and we realized how screwed over we were financially from my stepdad's misuse of our money. Things became tight financially, so I continued my student job I started the first semester of school, but I noticed my performance had dropped significantly from the previous semester, both in school and work. I got an academic probation, seeing that my GPA dropped under a 2.0 to a 1.66. But I was able to get an airline ticket as a prize in a lottery at work, so I thought I'd be able to relax by seeing my father and his side of the family down in Michigan. Heck, the next semester would be great if I came back relaxed! So I booked a trip right before the fall semester started. During summer, my stepfather overdosed on Ambien twice, strangled himself with a belt to passing out and tried suffocating himself with a bag. Finally, he was told to move out after he was hospitalized. This constant calling of 911 and being afraid there would be a dead body in our house kept everybody in the house on edge. Everybody was stressed, anxious, and terrified. Thankfully I was able to stay at another house for a couple days here and there when I needed to, but the stress still got to me. Then, during the trip to see my father, it turned out that he wasn't what we thought he was. I had brought my brother with me, and two days before we left, my father started verbally assaulting my brother over how he'd die if he were ever to be robbed, how my mother raised him wrong, how he would have raised us to be good christian children, how he wanted to take my little brother and force him to stay there. My father mocked him for having an online girlfriend, telling him he should be screwing every girl possible, told him that he was a pussy that needed to learn how to kill, and so forth. I hid in a room trying to stay away from the fight, but my stepmom dragged me out and started screaming at me at how i had told my mom that she was abusing my little brother, how I was totally conspiring against her when I was only 11. We later went to go on a boat ride, but on the way my step father screamed at us for being non-religious, that he was ashamed of us bieng his blood, that I was a pussy-footing failure, that neither of us woudl get anywhere in life, and finally that we better not tell our mother, as telling our mother would get him pissed off, and he told us that everybody that pisses him off would no longer exist on earth. So basically he threatened to kill us. So on the boat, my little brother called my mom while I kept a look out, and the next day our relatives in the town kept us away from our father as much as they could without raising suspicion. Then, past security at the airport we met up with my mother, where our father couldn't see, and went home. We were scarred from that, and we went to school full of stress and fright. I went to the counseling center at the university after breaking down when trying to tell my teacher what was wrong with me, but they said I was a bit too extreme to me and referred me to the psychological counseling center, who didn't accept me as I wasn't suicidal. So, I went to my former childhood therapist. My brother ended up dropping out. I got academically disqualified. I for some odd reason thought there was still hope that I could go to school this semester, but I wasn't able to. Turned out they removed me from the degree program, so I tried as a non-degree seeking student. Turns out that as a non-degree seeking student, I had no access to any of the loans or student aid I heavily relied upon, as my family has been spending pretty much every cent on the financial mess we were left in. I called the financial aid center and tried to see what I could do, and they said my only option was to go to class and pay out of pocket or go get a SAP appeal done. So, I emailed my academic counselor about it. This morning I got an email saying that I was pretty much removed from the university. The SAP appeal was only allowed for degree-seeking students, but seeing as how I became non-degree seeking a few days prior, I was disqualified from that.  I have no financial way to go to college without begging for money from my father or getting a job, which would interfere with university especially since I can't even drive yet. So, I'll have to take the next semester or two off to raise up money to go to college, but my loans only give me a grace period of six months, so I am afraid I won't have enough money to go to classes before that is up. Is there anything I can do to still go to college, or do I have to just drop out for the semester and work until I can afford it again? TL;DR A ton of screwed up shit happened during my last three semesters of college, and now I'm academically disqualified due to the mental stress this all caused me. I have no financial means of going to college. Is there still any hope of me going?","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}",No struggles found,,0
24,"I came from a family of 8 making $40k a year, no college degrees. I graduated in 2022 at the age of 23, and within that year I was making more than my father ever had. Because I was from such a poor family, my EFC was 0%, and because I purposely chose to go to a private out of state institution with a lot of money to give, I got a full ride (just a fun side note: I applied to state colleges who would’ve charged me 15k a year to attend). 2 years in community college for cheap or free (cheap when I was part time, free when full time) and then transferred out of state and got $75k tuition for absolutely free. No debt and I’m making more than anyone in my immediate family has any prospect of making. I could not do my job without my degree.
I will also say college immediately lifted me out of poverty too, by giving me access to on campus jobs, workstudy, and fafsa refunds every semester. The networking opportunities also continued to benefit me post graduation. I gained more wealth in college than I ever expected a person could. Obviously this is not necessarily standard but if people play their cards right it’s possible, and I’m always championing to the genuinely poor kids I know that they better not listen to their wealthier friends when they say college is a scam. It is different for adults who go to college later in life, because they are not dependents and may not have any dependents or spouse of their own. Often on paper adults seem like they’d be more capable of covering the costs of college than they really are, so that’s a tough one. Still talking to a college advisor and seeing what options you have (and not only looking at in state options!!!!) can’t hurt.","{'background': ['I came from a family of 8 making $40k a year, no college degrees.', 'My family could never afford', 'I, however, am poor', 'My family could never afford']}","['making $40k a year', 'no college degrees', 'EFC was 0%', 'charged me 15k a year to attend', 'no debt', 'making more than anyone in my immediate family has any prospect of making', 'access to on campus jobs', 'workstudy', 'faith refunds every semester', 'networking opportunities', 'gained more wealth in college than I ever expected a person could', 'dependents or spouse of their own', 'looking at in state options']",,0

i have about 70 credits towards a degree, i was aiming for a computer science degree but i have no way to pay for college now. i also taught myself a lot about programming independently. my last real semester at college was in fall 2014. however, i did take 1 class at rutgers last semester fall 2017 (computer architecture). i got an a in the class. i paid for that course with gift money from my 95 year old grandmother (about 2k). it was all my savings. probably was not a wise decision. 

i lived with an abusive mother most of my life. when college started for me, i did well for about 2.5-3years. i took federal loans to pay for college. then i got sick, and had to move back in with my abusive mother. worsened depression followed because i was living with an abusive mother, and i felt stuck there and stayed there for too long. once i got approved for ssd early this year, i was able to rent a room away from my abusive mother, but i'm struggling to get by.

i could lose my ssd which is my lifeline, by applying for federal loans. i would also regain the debt of my previous loans which had been forgiven, but that would happen anyway if i start making substantial income. the loans amount to 16k. additionally, when i left college because i became sick in 2014, i left during the semester past the point of withdrawal, so some classes turned to f's which ruined my gpa (which had been good before this point). according the financial aid office at rutgers, i am also ineligible for aid because of my gpa. 

i must have applied to like 100 software positions around me using websites like dice, both jobs and internships. my resume mainly makes use of my listed programming skills and my personal project experience, as i have no work experience or a degree. i was only called on to do 2 interviews from all those applications, both were for internship. one of the internships was unpaid for college credit (college credit that you still have to pay for). i did the interview anyway for experience, but essentially declined after that. the other internship is paid but it's only for the summer of 2018, and i'm still in the interview process so i may or may not get it.

rutgers computer science is overcrowded, so i couldn't even register for the courses i wanted to take this semester. i may be able to still register if i work for special permissions, but i don't see the point if i can't even find a way to pay for the courses. i wonder if i could scramble to get private loans (which i haven't looked at before) to pay for a few classes this semester, but i also wonder if that route is even worth it. the reality is. i taught myself more out of school than in school with programming, but i have zero luck applying for jobs with no degree on my resume.

my goal is to upgrade my living situation as soon as possible while still looking out for the long run. i am barely getting by how i am living right now. i am half way to a computer science degree but have no way to pay to continue college. i may be able to take out private loans if i explore that option but i don't know if it's worth it. i wonder if there is a different career in technology besides software developer that might get me started quicker. thoughts and advice are appreciated.","{'background': ['i lived with an abusive mother most of my life', 'i however am poor', 'my family could never afford']}","['getting by with help of food bank', 'paying for college', 'finding a job with no degree on resume', 'upgrading living situation', 'losing ssd lifeline', 'regaining debt of previous loans', 'ruined gpa', 'ineligible for aid', 'finding a way to pay for courses', 'scraping together private loans', 'different career in technology']",,0

i do currently work as a store assistant manager and thats what helps pay for my food etc but it isn't enough to rent a place in nyc unfortunately. 


any suggestions? what would you do?

i have no ""relatives"" or ""angels"" who can help me out, the crazy thing is my classmates would never know that im homeless. 


thanks you very much for your kind and inspirational words everyone, they keep me going.

i see your kind offers and i'm truly touched, i don't want to be a burden to anyone and neither do i want anyone finding out who i am, my classmates or future employers might be on this sub. 
until i atleast get my first job, i would like to keep this to myself.
that is why i cant do a crowdfunding or tell my administration.

i did check on the shelters and some other options, apparently they are so bad that drug addicts don't want to stay there, and if the option is decent you have to ant years in lotteries plus meet their criterias. 
i am looking for places in long island but no one wants to rent out to a student living out of a car running low on cash but i'm hoping to do that.
i have reached out to the administration, they added an extra $1000 to my scholarship to help pay for last semester. i haven't told them the extent of my situation at that point, because i grew to know faculty  members personally, plus, law schools as you know have a tendency of spreading info. i don't want to be ""that poor kid"" in school. i want to be normal, people will look differently at me.

i am currently in a coffee shop looking at some scholarships to apply for, i hope that will work out.
through this experince i have amassed an interest for public policy. i want to help the underserved people, the options for them are scarce in our busy society. 
 
also i've dropped one class so that i can pick up some better paying job.

34,"I'm 21 years old and i'm torn.  i've lost everything.  i'm leeching off my dad and his brother just to have a roof over my head.  i've tried to finance my education and fafsa isn't accepting my mother's social security number nor her tax papers.  my mother had to pay for my courses and i didn't even do that great in them because i didn't try.  i'm not smart, but i know how to study and learn concepts, it's just i lost all motivation because what is it worth if i'm going to die soon?  my parents are separated.  no one sees me in pain and i don't show it often.  no one bothers to understand my feelings or what type of hell i experience everyday in my life.  my girlfriend cheated on me.  i found out because she left her ipad in my car and i decided to charge it and make sure i log out of all my applications.  i just wanted to see our pictures one last time before i give it back and her photos from her phone were cloud saved.  there were pictures dated during the time we were together.  i have little money but i never ask for anything and i try to give to others as much as i can.  

yesterday, i attempted to end it all.  
i've been going through depression for 6 years, back to my early stages of high school.  my feelings have always been the same and nothing in my life has gotten better.  i've attempted suicide enough that everyone might think ""oh, he'll be fine.  it's probably like before.""

i've made it this far thanks to my hobby, my girlfriend, and my family.  i love cars and modifying them, but everyone thinks it's a waste of my time and money.  my girlfriend, who i thought to be supportive, ended up lying to my face.  i was going to join the military to support my father's side because they are low and my girlfriend, but whats the point if she's gone and i'm just leeching off my father?  my family, they used to support me but they hate anything i do now.  i'm a disappointment to them.  the really supportive members aren't here anymore and now i'm just an eyesore.

in short, i've been through hell for 6 years and everyone is treating me like shit.  i'm doing terrible in school, don't have the money to go to it, and don't have the motivation.  

i'm going to end my life but i can't because i can only think about what if it gets better, but i know it won't.  please don't sugar-coat and tell me it will because i know i'll be homeless in the future with no one to rely on.  i'm down to 4 figures and it's all for food, rent, gas, and school.  i can't find a job.  everything is just wrong.  i'm going to have the police take me down if i can't do it myself.","{'background': [""I'm 21 years old and i'm torn.  i've lost everything.  i'm leeching off my dad and his brother just to have a roof over my head.""]}","['lost everything', 'financing education', 'motivation', 'separated parents', 'pain', 'cheated', 'depression', 'attempted suicide', 'support', 'money', 'time', 'lying', 'military', 'family', 'disappointment', 'hell', 'homeless', 'no one to rely on', 'job', 'wrong']",,0

40,"First of all I'm going to be upfront. If you don't agree with my beliefs or background please leave this alone. If there are people who can legitimately help me I will be grateful beyond belief. I'm a 20 year old third year college student that's has an Associate of Science from a North Texas community college. I actually attained my degree about a semester ago, but due to certain limitations, I wasn't able to transfer earlier. I'm still living with my mother and brothers in the same city that I graduated from as the cc is also in the same city, so I really feel like the time has come for me to take the next step and see what's out there. The reason that I wasn't able to transfer earlier is because I'm an undocumented student. I can't apply for financial aid so almost all of my tuition costs for the cc have come out of my own pocket through hard work, dedication and most of all, the help of God. Stay with me here. My family and I have lived a rough life but we're just thankful to be alive and have a place we can call home. Those hardships we underwent though, have scarred us and it's been very difficult to live a 'normal' life. Last year, my mom found out that due to those hardships, including domestic violence and sexual abuse, we were eligible to apply for something called the 'U-Visa' where the country recognizes our hardships and grants us a work permit that will allow us to work legally in the U.S. It was like a miracle sent directly from God. We had just been counting on the Dream Act to pass so we could just continue our educations but this was idk a miracle.  The thing is, we filed our application last June but it takes a while for the USCIS to grant our acceptance or not so now we're just waiting to see what happens. I rest my entire faith on God that everything will go well. As I stated before, I already have my A.S. and really, really want to attend either UT Austin or TWU this fall but I have to be really careful with the application process as it could jeopardize the visa process. UT's been my dream school ever since high school, and with the visa, I'd be able to graduate and actually be able to apply for a job afterwards, unlike many other undocumented students who often graduate but are later stuck due to a lack of S.S. But now *I'm* stuck. Idk what to do. UT's an expensive school and their Fall 2012 deadline is coming up soon. If I apply and get accepted, I'd still have to wait for the permit decision. If I get granted the permit, I will be able to apply for FASFA and other scholarships or grants which I otherwise would've been unable to do so as an undocumented student. If I don't, Texas has it's own state version known as the TASFA which would help me but I can't make a decision until the permit comes since it could interfere with the decision. I could apply either way, but I would just wait to apply for financial aid later on and perhaps have to get a loan. Would y'all recommend me to apply and wait for the financial aid or just not apply at all and wait for the permit? My mom thinks it wouldn't be a bad idea to wait another year, perhaps work, and then go from there but I already feel like wasted enough time.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['living with my mother and brothers', 'domestic violence', 'sexual abuse', 'hardships', 'counting on the Dream Act', 'waiting for the USCIS to grant our acceptance or not', 'jeopardize the visa process', 'stuck', 'lack of S.S', 'financial aid', 'interfere with the decision', 'wasted enough time']",,0
41,"So in 2006 I dropped out of HS about 4 months from graduation because my family was verbally abusive and otherwise absent from my life. I moved away from home, found a job, and worked for a while before deciding that I wanted to do more with my life. So I got my GED, and got into college. I started my first semester in January 2010, and everything was great. But it wasn't meant to last. The first time I filed my FAFSA I went back home to my grandparents' (My 53 year old father lives with his 68 year old mother) and basically forced my father to sign the paperwork. I filled everything out for him because he wasn't going to. All he had to do was sign it, and it still took me about 3 weeks to get him to do it. But all was well, because the information was in on time, my EFC (Estimated Familial Contribution... or how much the college expects my family to pay) was $0. Financial Aid + Loans was enough to cover my living expenses + school. I had a 3.0GPA after my first semester of college. I was happy. That's where the good times ended. Every single year since then (I now live about 6 hours away from my Grandparents or Dad) my financial paperwork has gotten later, and later. And each time I get less and less aid. I remind him months in advance, email or fax him paperwork that's all filled out and just waiting for a signature. They need his tax information, which he doesn't file until early April if at all. He makes less than $5,000 a year because he doesn't work real jobs, and when he is working he either quits, or doesn't get paid by his sketchy employers. So I can't expect anything from him, and my grandparents are living on retirement. Ever since that first golden semester I've had at least 50% less money from the government to go to school meaning that I've been working at least 30 hours a week to maintain a barely full-time schedule. It's taken a toll on my grades so far, dropping me down to a 2.1 overall GPA. This last semester I ended up working 70 hours a week just to pay for my living expenses and bare necessities, including sparing money for my family when I could. My mother is constantly asking for money which she always promises to pay back but never does. Back on topic though, working 70 hours a week, and trying to take 12+ semester hours (That's ~60 hours of school work per week, according to the school expectations) is killing me. I'm now deep in loan debt, and my grades continue to suffer. I owe my roommate $3,000 because he kept me afloat when I was down. I owe my ex girlfriend $3,000 because she was helping me when I couldn't afford to eat and pay for classes. I want to finish my degree more than anything, but right now I'm in a situation where I can't file my own FAFSA without at least one parent, and my mother is trying to avoid it since she owes the IRS money. So it's relying on my King-of-procrastination father to get me the aid I need since I can't file as an independent until I'm 24 (next April). Everything would be fine if I could just get my financial aid information in on time. My EFC is $0, I would be completely clear to just focus on school but I can't do that until I file for next year's aid. Just looking for advice/options. Tanking my grades means spending even longer in school just retaking classes, and destroys my GPA.

43,"I started my bachelor's degree 10 years ago, as a last resort to keep from being homeless. My mom, a struggling alcoholic, was unable to help me out of high school, and the residence halls at college was the only last minute option. I didn't want to go to college.

(My background is important, as it it helps explain what my experience at college with Imposter Syndrome was like.)

I come from a low-income family of substance abusers, high school drop outs, and trauma. My father didn't make it through 8th grade and my mom dropped out in 9th, though eventually getting her GED. This is not to say she was not smart. Intelligence extends far outside of the academic institution. My father inevitably chose drugs and played a part in the dysfunction of my childhood, as I had to move every year, sometimes twice a year. Eventually, my grandmother gained custody of me (though she was far from stable, as well). Basically, I left one hell hole for another.

Through out my childhood, my mother preached and pushed education, always pushing me for AP classes, extra curriculars, scholars bowl, band, and a part time job. She always told me that education would be my only way out of the generational trauma and cycle. I do not agree with her, though she tried her best.

The Imposter Syndrome peaked it's head my freshman year of college. Mixed with instability and loneliness, the Imposter Syndrome was able to make me feel like I did not belong in school. I was always feeling a disassociation with the environment there and the monstrosity I come from, as well as the culture and social perspective of all the later generation students. I was working full-time trying to make ends meet. I struggled balancing this with marching band and student government association. My GPA at the time was less than a 2.3. I barely was getting by. I over exerted myself for perfection, and had to ""prove myself"" to others. I felt depressed and lonely.

A year before graduating with my bachelor's I ran out of money and had to work for a year and a half to save and finish. I also had to file for dependency override. I went back to school taking 20 hours in one semester, while working full time at a fast food restaurant. I ended up passing with all A's. I overcome my first battle, but this wasn't enough to warrant me walking across that stage. I still regret not walking.

This past year with the pandemic, I, on a whim applied for graduate school. I did not have the minimum GPA, but I wrote a genuine letter and pushed myself to communicate with the purest and rawest form of myself. I was accepted. With the help of my husband, I overcame Imposter Syndrome and am graduating next week with a 4.0 GPA. I wrote about Imposter Syndrome in first-generation students recently, and found it therapeutic. I finally acknowledged that I belonged, I am not a fraud, and I did it! You can bet that I will be walking across the stage this time with my head held high, and with my now sober mom in the audience.

Anyways, thanks for reading! I hope you push through anything life throws at you, and give it to yourself. You deserve it, and you are enough!","{'background': ['I come from a low-income family of substance abusers, high school drop outs, and trauma.', 'My family could never afford to send me to college, so I had to take out loans to pay for it myself.']}",No struggles found,,0
44,"Anyway starting in high school, neither of my parents ever went to school, and neither really believed in it. I was never pushed to do good in school, and never encouraged to pursue higher education. Just before I graduated, the two of them had a very long, drawn out and dramatic divorce. I had just gotten out of a relationship where I had been cheated on. I stopped caring about anything and lost myself in mindless things like video games. Eventually I met another girlfriend, and got a decent paying job netting me about 20$ an hour. I was still unhappy, but things felt like they were starting to look up. Until I realized this was just another dead-end job in a warehouse that I was miserable breaking my back at everyday, and even that girlfriend ended up having cheated on me for over a year of our 2 year relationship. I went into a slight depression, stopped working hard at work, and lost that job because of it. Being a dumb 20 year old at the time making that sort of money, I got a credit card thinking it would help build my credit; and it did - until I lost that job and could never pay it back. Now I'm pretty sure my credit is abysmal and I'll never be able to buy a new car let alone a house. After I lost that job, my mom kicked me out yet again, calling the cops and having them throw me out. I lived in my car in the freezing winter for almost 2 weeks before my dad let me come stay with him again - on the premise I enroll in school, which I did the next week. I was accepted soon thereafter, started working at my dad's business, and started going to school and doing well. I felt like my life was finally going somewhere. Those first 2 semesters, I held a 3.8 GPA going for a business major. However there were still some things that were getting at me - I had little to no friends, my dad's new wife hated me and made me feel worthless all the time, and because of that my dad told me I was ruining his new marriage, and to top it off I didn't even know what I was going to school for outside of my parents telling me to so that I would simply have a place to live. I started skipping class, which was infectious and go to the point I would only go on test days. My GPA dropped but I was still passing my classes; until in the latter part of my second year, my dad's shop started to do really poorly - he couldn't afford to buy new supplies or things to sell, and he somehow blamed me for it. I was doing the best that I could. I still to this day don't know how he thinks it was my fault. He didn't even pay me to work for him. So thinking that it was my fault his shop closed down, he again kicked me out. I used a bit of my financial aid loads to move into an apartment on the school campus. But again I became depressed, thinking my whole family hated me, I couldn't get a girlfriend that would ever love me and not cheat on me, that I would never have friends or a good job or even be able to get good grades. I started skipping to the point that I just stopped showing up to class altogether, and needless to say, failed most of them. My last semester there, I stopped going altogether and never went back. I ended with a sub 2.0 GPA and multiple failed classes. I now have about 25k$ in student loan debt without even having a degree to get a job good enough to pay it off with. During the time I was at school and working for my dad, gave my mom a bit of time to realize I really was trying, and she began to become much more caring. She understood that I was really struggling and once more let me come stay with her. Thankfully she did, because while there I met my now fiance who went to a school nearby there. Fast forward a few years, and me and her have decent stable jobs in a new town, in a new state. Along the way, I've found an all-encompassing passion for physics and astronomy, and feel for the first time actual drive to finish my schooling. It makes me regret everything I've done along the way besides meeting my fiance, and wish that I could do everything all over, but I can't. And now I sit here, wondering if its even possible to get a PhD in physics and astronomy with all the things I've done wrong compiled into my now life. Thinking that I might not ever to achieve that dream because of my many past failures makes me sometimes want to just end it all. I don't even know where to begin to finish my studies - I know credible schools won't take me with the grades and attendance record I've gotten, and the community colleges around here either don't have the programs I'm looking for and even if they do, I don't know if they'll even add up to me getting a bachelor's from a reputable school since by next year I'll have 3 years worth of credits amounting to nothing; I have a sum of 2 years of business classes combined with extracurriculars, so would going to community college mean I'm starting all over? Let alone going on for a PhD somewhere even better. Why would anyone ever accept me with my record as a PhD candidate when as of now I'm pretty sure no one reputable would even consider me a BS candidate. Even if it was possible to line everything up perfectly, I wouldn't graduate with my PhD until I was almost 40. That in itself is discouraging enough.

He didn't have a job and I was aimless in school, but I did well. We decided that we wanted to be sucessful and have fought tooth and nail since. I gradated with two undergrad degrees and got into a very good law school. I always picked up side jobs to make extra money and ended up being a janitor for a long time and took out as much financial aid as I could to ensure a roof over our head.

We supported and helped each other and did more when the other couldn't. We did it together and I'm not sure we could have otherwise.

The Food Pantry: A life saver. I get oil, milk, and produce from here. This semester they are located outside of MLK. You should also look into applying to Cal Fresh. If you need assistance doing so the basic needs center has workshops that will guide you through the process.
Libgen: They’ve had almost every textbook I’ve needed. I haven’t had to purchase a single book since my first semester
Co-ops: Apply to the coops! The rent in the apartments is super cheap and you get your own room. Try taking a look at X. The houses are a bit more pricey but it’s probably better than anything off campus.
COA: You can ask for a cost of adjustment to see if you can get more financial aid. I believe they can also reimburse you for a laptop through the financial aid office.

55,"Alright, this is a serious question, that I'm hoping someone on the outside looking in can help me understand, explain and/or see. I don't understand what is my purpose here in life. What is my life's purpose? And here's a little about my life. I'm thirty, when I was about seven, I had a good chance of leaving here and dying when I almost drowned in my uncle's pool. However, I was saved by mu uncle and I'm still here. All during my years in Elementary school, I had no friends and when I say no friends, I don't mean like one friend or two friends, I mean, I had no friends. Why? Because during my years in elementary, while all the other kids were busy tongue kissing boys and acting all fast and wild, I was this nerd into studying, books and education and writing and into the arts, so I was without friends and severely bullied several times over. Anyway, my mom and I are poor (and no I'm not asking anyone for anything, so relax, I don't want a handout, I want an answer as to my life's purpose), and when I say poor, I mean, poor to the point where, for all but about three or four years of my living, my mom and I have lived in shelters, and sometimes in storage units. I'm thirty and my mom is in her sixties and we're still homeless. We aren't on welfare or on government assistance, because we don't want a handout or anything handed to us, we want to work hard like everyone else for things, but trying to find a job is hard. You go out and send out resumes for teaching jobs and you know you have the experience but these jobs never call. You send out resumes for ANY job out there and no one calls - what do you do? You lose your place of living. And being homeless in the dead of winter is hard on me, yeah but I don't care about myself so much as I do my mom. She has asthma, COPD and being homeless has been hard and extremely tough on her. She has been battling bronchitis/pneumonia for weeks now and she's been without medicare, because she doesn't have money to buy medicare, so she can't get her sickness treated. Then there are agencies and such that can help people from being homeless - sure, but you call these agencies and such and they're either way too swamped helping others, to be able to help anyone else or they can't help because they themselves have run out of funds to help others. So what do you do? You can't find a job, you lose your place of living, you can't afford medicare, government agencies and such won't help - what do you do? So, last night, I tried taking a few pills and ending it, but here I am, awake another morning. I don't know if maybe self-consciously, I purposely didn't take enough pills or if I did and God just refuses to take me out of this life, because my purpose is to keep suffering, but I am so, so tired of this life, of this world, where everything you want, you can never have, unless you're rich, where people are so mean and cruel to you and treat you like crap, where you pray and pray to a God that you've been told exists and nothing happens. I just - I'd like to know why was I put here? What is my purpose for being here? I think if I weren't here, maybe my mom would be better...If someone can read everything I put here and determine what my purpose is, I'd be forever grateful, because I have no idea and it's to the point where everyday, I'm literally hoping to get struck by a stray bullet or hit by a car so I can be put out of my misery. Because people don't believe this, but every day is like being slowly eaten from the inside out, by a cancer with no hope in sight for being cured.

59,"Hello, I am moving out of my Dad's House in a few days, I will be 18 when I leave. My situation is rather unique. My parents are divorced, and I have lived with my Dad since I was 15 and have received no support from my Mom or anyone from her side of the family since I moved into my Dad's house. I am Graduating High School Early in 2 weeks, and I potentially have the Stats to get into a Top 20 private college, but I can't because of finances. I Can't fill out the CSS profile at all because my Mom's side of the family said they won't help me with college, or fill out any forms for me unless I go to X (absolutely not an option for my sanity). I filled out the FAFSA for the 2021-22 year with my Dad already as we are still on speaking terms, but after I move out It is very unlikely that he would will lever help me with any future FAFSA forms. I am really hoping that for future academic years I am able to get a dependency override. My Dad is a borderline hoarder, and the house is a semi-health hazard. The house is covered in junk and dog hair. Nearly every square inch of open space has something on it. The Bathrooms are completely disgusting, and I have not been allowed to clean them because my dad is sensitive about me touching his stuff. The kitchen is absolutely disgusting. Rotting food and dished covering all the counter space. This summer there were bugs in the sink, but they are gone now. There is a big ass hole in the ceiling in the basement because there was a leak in the kitchen above that basement. There are ceiling pieces all over the floor right outside my room. My Grandma had a guy come look at the sink in the kitchen, and he diagnosed the problem but there wasn't enough money to fix it. He also said there is mold under the sink in the kitchen, but again no money for that. I personally have not been able to find the mold. We have also had insurance people drop us because there is mold all over the roof of the house itself. There was a random wet spot that showed up on the carpet one day. After a month, I finally convinced my Dad to do something about it, and he just ripped up the carpet in that spot, and didn't do anything further. Personally, I can add my own context to the situation. For about a year after moved in with my Dad, I had to live out of a suitcase in a room filled with junk in the upstairs part of the house. The Air conditioning in the house only works in the basement, and there was a perfectly good room in the basement that I could have slept in, but my Dad wanted me to be close to him at night so he wouldn't get lonely. (He also had a room upstairs, but he had a big window and a fan in his room, I didn't.) So I got to spend the summer sleeping in a 90+ degree room, so my Dad wouldn't get lonely. I also got a job that summer at 15 because up to this point I was often dealing with hunger. My Dad refused to go to the Welfare office to get more food stamps for me, or go to any private charity because he was embarrassed. After that summer the level of abuse went down. I had a job so I could pay for all of the living expenses and food that he was failing to pay for. I eventually moved into the basement room, and just moved all of my Dad's stuff out of it. It was a major shit show, with him forcing me to move back upstairs into the heat once, but eventually I got my own climate controlled space. Just Wondering if the house video and my own account would be enough for a dependency override. I won't be homeless when I move out, I have a lot of savings and a car and I am working 30 hours a week at my job. I guess one could say I will be at risk of going homeless, that might be a stretch though.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['financial struggles', 'psychological struggles', 'physical struggles', 'social struggles']",,0
60,"I try to put this in a logical order but I apologize if I end up rambling a bit. I am a couple years out of school and am making ends meet. I dont have a lot of money and I have a lot of debt, but I still lead a good life. Work is challenging, but only occasionally stressful, and I have a very good group of friends that are always there for me no matter what. However, I think I am reaching a breaking point with my family. A little background of  my parents have struggled with money for years. My dad works in an industry where it has been incredibly difficult for him to keep a job. I'm almost positive its nothing to do with his job performance based on various things over the years. I just think his industry (health care) has been incredibly tough. They were able to help me pay some for college but I still had to take out quite a bit in student loans. During that time (I also worked a lot through college), I gave my parents a lot of money (thousands) from my savings (dried up years ago), what I earned working in college, and from my student loans. I had worked a lot in high school before things went south for the family. I saved up and bought a car junior year and still had a good amount of savings when I graduated. I feel it important to point out that it doesn't bother me I gave them money. My family needed help and I did it without thinking twice. I am not saying it wasn't hard for me but I never really had to think about doing it. All of our accounts were linked though our bank for years. It's been that way my whole life (meaning since this was an available service) and that was how my parents gave us our allowance. It later turned into how I would give my parents money and my account was often drained to pay overdraft fees of others (after this starting happening I opened a new account at a separate bank and closed this one shortly after I started my new job). After college I took a job in a new city and am now far away from my family. Over the past few years I have been giving my brother money (also to the tune of thousands) not including co-signing student loans. I know some may comment that this wasn't a smart financial decision but like I said before this is my family. I have made financial mistakes in the past and am still paying for those but I have also learned a lot from them and am much smarter with my money and spending habits. He hasn't had the same support system I had (although I paid or am paying for a lot of my school still) and my parents are no longer able to help him. But now I feel I need to make a tough decision. I need to cut them off financially. It's gotten to the point that every time I get a call from a family member (more below) I immediately stress out and that stress and anger linger for hours and sometimes for days after the call (partially because I wish it wasn't this was but since it is this way I wish I could do more). This has been getting worse over the years too. THIS is the most stressful thing in my life by far. Nothing is even close. I am incurring even more debt to help him, some of which includes his expensive medical bills. I told him yesterday that I couldn't afford to help him (this time) but he still called me late last night desperately asking for money. Frankly, I can't do this anymore. I feel bad saying no but I don't think I have any other option at this point. At some point I need to be able to live my life and work my way out of this financial hole. I think I need to take the following actions or some variation but I could really use feedback. Is it too harsh? Am I going about this the wrong way? I don't want to call anybody out and I don't want to point fingers but I don't think they realize the toll that this has taken on me and I think they need to understand this, where I am coming from, and that they need to figure out what needs to be done.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor', 'My family could never afford', 'My dad works in an industry where it has been incredibly difficult for him to keep a job.']}",No struggles found,,0

My best advice is to find paid internships ASAP. I got my first one the summer between freshmen and sophomore year. Increased my pay by 50%.

Even with covering some tuition out of pocket, buying a brand new car, paying off $10k worth of credit debt when I married my husband, and paying off a $5k student loan of his, I will be graduating with around $22k in the bank. Keep in mind that’s combined. If I rode out my old car (cost me $2k, was a beater) and hadn’t gotten married and helped out my husband, I would have graduated college with over $45k. Marriage was worth it imo, but I’m just saying it’s really easy to grow your income and savings while in college as long as you put in the effort.
Also should mention I lived with a single mom who makes right above the poverty line. She did not pay a dime for anything of mine either. Sounds like you knew your parents weren’t going to help you much and you have a plan. Stick with it and you’ll be fine!","{'background': ['I, however, am poor', 'My family could never afford', None]}","['financial struggles', 'paying out of pocket', 'covering some tuition', 'buying a brand new car', 'paying off credit debt', 'paying off student loans', 'living with a single mom who makes above the poverty line']",,0

68,"well i was a ward of the state by the time i was 15 so i was eligible for etv which is a sister program to nc reach. since i graduated at 16 and moved out of my guardian pro tempore's place, i kept in contact with my case worker. she helped arrange me with etv funding. however the coordinators changed it seemed every three months, any requests i made for counseling, therapy, budgeting and general life skills was always boiled down to impersonal email exchanges and giving a 16 year old a monthly check is great but without stability or life skills at the time it only did so much. i don't want to give the wrong impression that i've done absolutely nothing to get myself into this situation but i can't help but feel that as soon as i graduated high school, the state government just stopped giving a damn. yeah i made mistakes at 16, if you consider not being able to find a job, a place and a reliable form of transportation at that age a mistake. it was during that time i got dropped for absences two semesters in a row. since then i have retaken those classes and gotten better grades. my cumulative gpa is back to where i can get into any state public universities, and i haven't taken out a single loan so far. i did go back and speak with an adviser who informed me that if i were to change schools i could more than likely get my financial aid back, i just couldn't get it any longer at the school i just got my two year degree from. my next goal is looking into private aid like you mentioned. i'm currently applying to three different places and when i'm done with the applications i will call each place and talk with them about financial aid. one of the colleges are in town where i live so i'll go down and speak to someone in person. i just want to make sure i'm adequately prepared and have copies of both my high school transcript and college transcript so i can have something on hand to explain to them the disparities between them both. most of my junior year of high school was spent taking college courses and my entire senior year was completely college level coursework. so i have the advantage of showing them that when i was in a stable place, college level coursework posed no problems with me academically. my only barriers were trying to survive so young on my own and not knowing how to juggle everything at once. hell i'm in my early twenties now and ideally i should have been done with a four year by now, but a friend told me the other day that life is 10% planning and 90% readjusting. didn't really make me feel any better i just don't want to come to the realization that maybe the advantages i awarded myself have been squandered already.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor', 'My parents could no longer afford to keep me fed with a roof over my head', 'My family could never afford', 'I, however, am poor', 'My family could never afford']}","['absences', 'finding a job', 'a place', 'reliable transportation', 'surviving on my own', 'juggling everything at once', 'readjusting']",,1

93,"it was valentine's day in 2009, and i was a first-year living in echols. i made a reservation downtown for a rather fancy dinner with my then-girlfriend; flowers, then dinner, then a potential stroll down main street to cap it off. it was definitely romantic in my head, and for a marginally poor first-year college kid, on paper it sounded like a rather nice night. on paper. what i didn't take into account was the variability of townie behavior. an obvious issue was transportation; as first-years, we had no access to a car, and downtown was more than just a simple walk from old dorms. no matter, the uts trolley was pretty clutch and would get us to where we needed to go. dressed up, loving the cheesiness of a ""date"" on valentine's day, we made our way to the restaurant to have a rather delicious (and *expensive*) dinner, complete with a romantically cheesy walk. now that i'm thinking back to it, i really can't picture a date going any better; the comical nature of the type of night we had complimented how it ended. *""our life, right?""* was an oft-used phrase when we thought back to that night. after the walk, we made our way back to the uts trolley stop just past the ice rink. i surveyed the crowd when we got there: a few other uva-looking couples out on the town for the same reason, a few townies presumably making their ways back to uva, and a few homeless townies loitering by the actual bus stop structure. one of the homeless men caught my eye, in a subtle way that i can't really explain. he had stringy, *wet*-looking long hair, a really burly beige coat, and had a tanned skin complexion. if i had had to guess an ethnicity, i'd have said mexican or latino. he was a little closer to us than the rest, so i kinda kept my eye on him while my gf and i waited for the trolley. it was then that i noticed he had a knife in his hand... the knife wasn't any sort of hunting or killing blade, nor was it a butter knife or plastic. it just looked like one of the random assortment of kitchen knives you may have for bread-slicing or whatever, and was definitely serrated. he was holding it concealed in his palm, but it was peeking out far enough from his sleeve that i noticed it. i quickly looked around to see if anyone else had, and then whispered to my gf and did a little dance-rotation so she would be in a position to see it, too (at that point, we were half huddle-hugging because it was a little cold out). she confirmed it and we started whispering, freaked out. i kept observing him, silently hoping that he wasn't going to get on the trolley as well. he walked over to the other homeless guys, who acknowledged him in a relatively friendly way, and then *brandished the knife at them*. a few of them kinda staggered back in mock surprise, probably savvy to the fact that he wasn't going to actually use it on them, but was joking around. it honestly looked like he was trying to show off possessing a blade. sure enough, the trolley arrives about 10 minutes later, and sure enough he gets on it with everyone else. my girlfriend and i made sure to scootch back towards the opposite end of the bus, as did the other patrons at the bus stop who undoubtedly saw the same thing i did. the thing was, the trolley was *packed*. people had to stand up, and there was absolutely no room for anyone to be comfortable. if the man had wanted to, he could have injured a looooot of people before being restrained, because we were all cramped together. we really didn't know if we should've mentioned something to the bus driver, but the fact that he was getting on the bus directly behind us and the overall nervousness, we just wanted to get to our dorm stop and then gtfo asap. after we got back to the dorm room, we freaked out a little out loud and nervously had a giggle. we joke nowadays that we almost died that night, but i'm sincerely glad i didn't hear anything about him the next day in the news. *** funny story, a few weeks later, i saw the same homeless man sitting on the northline heading from the chemistry bus stop. he looked bored and was sitting in between two chatty girls. i immediately *nope'd* and got on the next bus...","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['financial struggles', 'psychological struggles', 'social struggles', 'physical struggles']","['made a reservation downtown for a rather fancy dinner', 'took the UTS trolley', 'dressed up', 'made our way to the restaurant', 'had a romantically cheesy walk', 'waited for the trolley', 'observed him', ""hoped he wouldn't get on the trolley"", 'got on the next bus']",1

121,"i actually graduated from ole miss and moved to mesa almost a year ago so i feel like i might have some insight to the changes you'll face. 1. you'll probably feel a bit of a disconnect from most of the lowerclassmen you encounter around the university but there are lots of 30 somethings around the town and in the graduate programs. 2. i studied abroad with a 28 year old guy who ended up dating the attractive 19 year old sophomore on the trip. be polite and attractive and you'll be just fine. 3. if you can swing it try to live walking distance to the square, the closer the better. that's where the best restaurants, bars, festivals, and other activities take place. being 31 you'll be eligible for a lot of the nicer places that won't rent to undergrad students. i knew people who lived in the ice house and high cotton and they were very nice and convenient. 4. check craigslist for subleases. lots of people end up moving out early for various reasons and need someone to cover their lease. a lot of times you can get these subleases for really cheap because the person just doesn't want to have to eat the whole cost. 5. even though i grew up in ms i never had an accent and nobody ever gave me shit for it. especially in oxford you won't see as much southern accent as you might think. i actually get more shit here in az for not having a southern accent haha. 6. cops in oxford are usually good guys as long as you are respectful to them. i've only had good experiences with them. your milage may vary however. 7. there is a lot of stuff to do around. explore the rest of mississippi and tennessee whenever you get a free weekend. memphis, tupelo, clarksdale can all be fun day trips. there is the holly springs national forest that is open to the public for hunting but a lot of it is wildlife management areas and private land is scattered throughout so talk to a ranger first. everyone i knew hunted on private land. 8. oxford is a completely different place when during winter and summer intersessions. there are students around but much fewer. the actual oxford residents seem to come out of hiding and getting around is so much faster, restaurants are quiet and easy to get a table. it's awesome. 9. freshman tend to all wear the same thing but they grow out of it. you should be fine wearing whatever you normally wear. the preppy dress code is a definitely a misconception. football games are another matter though. do dress up for those, it's a wonderful tradition. 10. this is going to be the biggest change for you. it was the biggest for me moving to mesa anyway. there are pretty much only two chain restaurants in oxford: applebee's and chilis... and if you eat there i feel sorry for you. oxford has amazing local restaurants and enough variety to keep you from getting too tired of anything. please don't worry about the lack of a chipotle or in n' out, you'll be in food heaven. no trader joe's, pretty much just walmart and kroger for groceries. 11. the large majority of people are from the south but with the influx of others the atmosphere is unlike much of the rest of the south. 12. memphis is the only real place you have to worry about. 13. pretty much everyone curses just like they do everywhere else. 14. try lake sardis for fishing. 15. from what i've heard getting in-state tuition isn't easy. 16. be polite. it's going to be a huge change from arizona but i hope you like it. i definitely miss a lot of things about oxford. learn to love amazon because there aren't many specialty shops in the area like there are here. try as many local places as you can, there's no reason to go to fucking chilis while you are in oxford. if you want to experience real mississippi venture out to some of the smaller towns that surround oxford like taylor, pontotoc, the delta. volunteer if you can, there are a lot of unfortunate people in mississippi that will appreciate any help you can muster and you'll get a really unique experience seeing the ""real"" mississippi that most people in oxford never even see. i'm jealous! i love it here in arizona, but oxford is a truly unique place. have fun!","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['financial struggles', 'psychological struggles', 'physical struggles', 'social struggles']","['study abroad', 'live walking distance to the square', 'check craigslist for subleases', 'explore the rest of mississippi and tennessee', 'volunteer', 'try lake sardis for fishing']",1

124,"two words: tuition indexation. grad students who are members of the union (tas and graduate assistants, the latter of which are usually mas who do research for profs) are protected against tuition increases. the reason for this is to prevent the university, who is also our employer, to claw away at our wages by increasing tuition. there's no point in getting a 1% wage increase if the university then turns around increases our tuition by 3%. our wages are already well below the poverty line and increases in tuition would reduce it even further. this is a protection that was won during a strike in 2000-2001. as has been said numerous times, the university recently increased international student fees by about $7000 pretty much overnight and without virtually any warning. the union interprets this as a violation of our collective agreement and the university doesn't. our worry is that the university is going to do the same to domestic students, so we're trying to get new language in the contract that would both reduce international student fees and prevent the university from doing to domestic students what they did to international students. so in other words, while the focus has been on international student fees, what we're asking for would in fact protect every grad student in the union regardless of where they're from.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['tuition increases', 'wages below poverty line', 'increases in tuition would reduce it even further', 'violation of collective agreement', ""university doesn't"", 'worried about university doing the same to domestic students', 'reducing international student fees', ""protect every grad student in the union regardless of where they're from""]",,1

127,"long post and i've had a lot on my mind, so throwaway account. yes, i was there. they were quite loud and i personally did not find the need to bring a megaphone into a small enclosed space. the protestors claimed that they would protest until their demands are met, but my question is what exactly they're demanding? the firing of a student making minimum wage working to pay rent and college tuition? a bit of background information: there was a planned event that was supposed to take place this weekend, a game called sloshball. in short, sloshball is basically kickball, except you have a beer in your hands at all times. there was nothing on the facebook event page that said the word coho, that it would take place on campus (it was to be at slide hill park) or to dress up in mexican or border patrol attire. there was never the word border patrol even used. the border patrol outfit that was seen in a controversial photo used in this protest was an old photo that was dug up from a facebook account of one of the employees. it was a halloween costume back from october of last year. now, i acknowledge that it was a poor choice for a costume. however, that photograph is irrelevant to the claims being made about the event that was planned for *this* weekend. the event was not planned by solely caucasians, but by several people of different ethnic backgrounds. the organizers realized their mistake when an employee approached them and let them know that it was offensive. they cancelled the event, promising to re-host the game with a different theme. but that wasn't before the group of current protestors caught wind of this event and brought it to public attention. personally in my experience, the mature thing to do would be to have the leaders of the two sides meet and try to hear the other side out. side a would be like, ""hey we found that offensive, please change the theme."" and ideally side b would work with them to figure something out and to keep it within the organizations. now this whole thing has gotten blown up to ridiculous proportions, using the coho as a platform to raise awareness about other social issues of diversity and cultural tolerance. and at what cost? i know many people that work at the coho. some of them who have worked there for a long time have told me, ""for the first time in the three years that i've worked at the coffee house, today i could not perform my duties in providing great customer service. not with people coming up to me asking me if i was racist or how i could think it was a good idea. in the coffee house, my second home with my coho family, i felt really threatened and uncomfortable to be there."" the event was not made with malicious intent. it was meant to act as a theme for a game at which friends could have a few drinks and laughs. it was an excuse to get out and hang with coworkers. the organizers have repeatedly apologized to the group, but protest organizers refused apologies claiming that they were not sincere. since acknowledging that the event theme was offensive, what more can they do besides cancelling the event (already done), and making public apologies? kcra and cbs sac have already aired their reports about today's protest. but they are heavily one-sided. yes, the coho is being used as a platform. but the protestors do not seem to realize the impact that this has on the employees that were in no way involved. everyone is worried about how the reputation of the coho on their resumes will affect them in search for future jobs. generalizing the entire coffee house's employees as a group of racists is not okay. yes, it was bad judgement on the event planners' part, but what more is there to do at this point? just my two cents.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor', 'My parents could no longer afford to keep me fed with a roof over my head', 'My family could never afford', 'I, however, am poor', 'My family could never afford']}","['personally did not find the need to bring a megaphone into a small enclosed space', 'the event was not made with malicious intent', 'it was an excuse to get out and hang with coworkers', 'the organizers have repeatedly apologized to the group', 'the protestors do not seem to realize the impact that this has on the employees that were in no way involved', ""generalizing the entire coffee house's employees as a group of racists is not okay""]",,1

159,"**did you know what you were doing, did you do any applications, were you on a bandwagon? or were you helped very well by your college counselors/high school counselors?** my high school's guidance counselor gave a presentation in class once saying that everybody needs to go to college instead of joining the military because you'll make so much more money. i went to a poor school, and most of use went into the military or a tech school when we graduated (i picked military). that was it. i've heard so many kids tell me about how their school had placement tests, special college counselors on payroll, prep courses, and etc. i'm not trying to complain here but, with the bachelors degree becoming a commodity, a significant portion of the college bound population comes from poor areas like i did. we had no direction and didn't know the first thing about going to college. i didn't even know the difference between a ba and a bs until i was like 19 and already a full time student. *what were the five major issues you had?* 1. not knowing which degrees were valuable in the grand scheme of things. i graduated with all sorts of honors and research under the impression that if i was just a really good student i wouldn't have to worry about a job. i was told by professors and faculty that worrying about a job is for the kids who flunk out of stuff and don't do so hot. i found out the hard way that good grades do not equal job placement. 2. i didn't realize the pedigree of the school counted. i know completely lackadaisical students with criminal records who graduated from penn state with the exact same degree i have that who began jobs almost instantly making $40,000 a year. and here i am with cum laude honors, an officer in two clubs, early graduation from high school, first college enrollment at 16, honorably discharged veteran, graduated early from college with two majors and a minor, struggling to get a job that pays $20,000 so i can survive. i can barely afford my inner city apartment, and have been unemployed for eight and a half months. the pedigree counts. 3. professor's don't have a lot of accountability. i became very good friends with many of my professors and would spend time with them outside of class (having dinner, parties at their houses, and etc.). i was shocked to find how often departments sweep sexual harassment under the rug, how professors often don't even do reading assignments, and how much faith is put into the professor's ability to make up a grade overall. regardless of how many complaints they get, unless there's undeniably a race thing or sex thing publicly going on, nothing is going to happen. even then, nothing might happen. perhaps you've heard of millersville university. after countless attempts to report a professor for sexually harassing her and the department not doing anything, a nontraditional female student went to the lancaster newspaper and submitted copies all of the lewd harassing emails he wrote to her. it was all published in the paper. this includes him talking about how he ""wanted to smack her ass"" and other explicitly obvious means of sexual harassment. i won't post the article, but this was in 2011. i will instead post this article written about the same student [here](ýçùþ_x009f_£¤êüå_x0093_íùå_x0093_ñôá¤öîí_x0096_­©¦_x009d_ _x009c_¨) . just for the record, he still works there and has had no remedial action. so people can say what they want to say, but if you get a crummy professor there isn't much you can do. if they don't read assignments, give grades arbitrarily, are passively racist, sexist, or even sexually harass you - expect your school to cover its own ass and follow the money. 4. the cost. all of us are in endless debt. student loan debt surpassed credit card debt several years ago, which speaks volumes about how bad it is. i had the gi bill and am an honorably discharged veteran, and i *still* had to take out loans to cover all of my classes and books. 5. finally, i thought the atmosphere was not as academic as it put itself off to be. maybe i was naive for buying into the hype and thinking it would be a community of scholars, but it was a lot like high school. not a lot of people were excited about learning or having discussions in class. when good honest professors tried to get people to respond to questions in class, it was like they were pulling teeth. i got tired of being the only person in class who would respond and eventually would stop, and then nobody would say anything. i've literally had professors just walk out of class because so few of us would even do basic reading assignments. people would bully gay students, people were racist, people would bully kids who talked in class a lot, and honestly it wasn't the academic environment it was cracked up to be. every time i share this story on reddit people down vote or disagree with me because of this perception they have that the college has some monopoly on learning. the truth is that it doesn't, and the only monopoly university has is on the ability to bestow degrees. all education is ultimately self education. while the school can give you resources and try to produce an environment that's conducive to learning, it's up to the individual student to actualize those resources. furthermore, almost all of those resources and better environment exist freely elsewhere. the idea that you're going to go off to school and have this wonderful quasi-hogwartz ""college experience"" wasn't true for me. people can say whatever they want, but i was in several academic clubs and eventually just started going out into the surrounding community to find other people interested in scholarly stuff because the academic community just wasn't at the school. just watch how students respond during a snow day or when class gets cancelled. education is the only business where you can screw people out of what they paid for and they'll be excited about it. if i could do it all over again, i wouldn't have gone to college. i maybe would have gone to a trade school and read kant in my spare time, but having a professor talk to me about it wasn't really that much more edifying. even if i would have worked at mcdonald's and lived with my grandmother coming out of the army, i would be in a much better financial position than i am in now. i do want to convey that i had a lot of fun while i was there and made some great memories, but the purpose of going and paying all that money is supposedly to get an education. secondly, i've found that i got way more reading of quality texts and have spent more time in way more academic communities since i left college. even reddit has subreddits that are way more stimulating than any of the conversations i've heard in college classes. it's very ironic and it's one of the main points people try to dispute, but i think that i probably would have a better command of even the things i studied if i didn't go to school. lectures from ivy league schools and full college courses are available online, and scholarly communities like reading groups exist freely within almost all cities. i wouldn't say that i had a bad or negative experience, i guess what i'm trying to say is that i didn't have a $60,000 experience. i think that answers both questions.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['not knowing which degrees were valuable in the grand scheme of things', ""i didn't realize the pedigree of the school counted"", ""professor's don't have a lot of accountability"", 'the cost', 'the atmosphere was not as academic as it put itself off to be']",,1

169,"&gt; how the hell do you all afford it? out of state tuition is around 52,000 a year, so is michigan really generous with scholarships or something? out of state here ... loans, and lots of them. you don't say what demographic you are, but i can tell you that the number of scholarships for middle class white males is pretty damn low. &gt; what's the social scene like? is it mostly greek, or is it a lot of house parties and stuff? are people usually pretty open? there's a lot of greek, but also a lot of house parties. most people tend to think that they're open minded, as long as you agree with their political views anyway. &gt; is there a lot of school spirit? do people get excited for football/basketball games? no, our attendance is the worst in the nation. &gt; how challenging is it, academically? i've taken some pretty boring/easy classes in high school, and i'm hoping to avoid those in college. i'm lsa, undecided major. it's as challenging as you want it to be. you can coast along in an easy lsa major and never stress yourself out. or you could take the tougher classes that are more interesting but also more work. &gt; what's the living situation? do most people live on or off campus? it's been a little while since i was in university housing ... but most (nearly all) freshmen live in a dorm. a good number of 2nd year students do as well ... but a lot try houses or greek societies. the way the housing works out you really need to set something up asap for the next semester if you want a prime location, and doing that your first year is a bit of a crapshoot. many of the houses and apartments ""off campus"" are within a good tee shot or two of the university ... so distance isn't really an issue. &gt; are the classes huge? i come from a small high school (200 kids) and i've had classes with as few as 3 people. i'm not expecting anything like that in college, but will every class be a 500 person lecture? no, not all are huge. general requirements can be very big classes, freshman physics, math, into philosophy, they're all big lectures (200+) with smaller discussion sections (25?). the farther along you get the smaller the classes will get. senior level classes can be 10-15 students very easily. &gt; what's the intramural scene like? i played a lot of sports in high school, but wasn't good enough to play d1. is there a strong intramural/club sports scene? particularly soccer and lacrosse. i can't remember ever seeing anyone playing lacrosse ... but i know that there are a lot of im soccer leagues, some even play indoors during the winter. &gt; i haven't visited, but from what i read online the campus seems huge. how do you get around? do people bring cars, or is it more walking? do a lot of students have bikes? are there buses? the bus system is pretty good for getting around campus. getting out to the rest of town, going to a movie, or to the mall to go shopping, is a lot harder. there are busses that go out there (free for students, or really cheap), but the timing is more sparse and the trips longer. freshmen don't typically have cars, getting a parking pass as a freshman is very hard, and there aren't a lot of spaces you can use it. (have to pay to park in other lots instead, expensive.) many people walk a lot, a good number ride bikes. when it gets really cold and snowy and nasty the bike population drops off a lot though. &gt; how easy is it to double major or add a minor or something? i'm not sure i want to tie myself down to just one major. depends on the major. as an engineer i'm only familiar with our programs, but some overlapped nicely and you could double with an extra semester, others required easily an additional year. you have to check the specific departments. &gt; how easy/hard is it to switch colleges? i applied to lsa, but what if i find out i really want to go into athletic training, or education, or pharmacy? relatively easily. there's just some paperwork to transfer as an undergrad. but you may not be able to count all the classes you've already taken towards the new degree, check first. &gt; last question. do you, personally, like going to michigan? if you had to pick again, is this where you would want to go to college? yes, that's why i'm still here after 10 years. (no, i'm not van wilder, i stayed for a mse and a phd in engineering.) as much as i love michigan ... i have to caution you that getting a 4-year degree, any 4-year degree, without some form of plan for how you're going to use it is a big mistake. you can easily rack up $100k in student debt over your time here. make sure that the degree that you choose, and the connections that you make, are worth it. that's not to say ""thou shalt learn engineering because it is the only way you'll get a job"" ... but it does mean that you need to consider what you want to do when you graduate. if you want to become a teacher, and expect to earn $40k/year when you start out, you may want to look at another alternative. if you want to go into public policy, or business, or anything, you should start making connections with people as soon as possible. the degree doesn't get you a job, the people that you meet do. /rant **in case you didn't already know, we set the national football attendance record for the week every home game.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}",No struggles found,,1
170,"&gt;i never said you earn 80k a year as grad students/tas. i was trying to point out that your assertion that the wage level wasn't fair is unfounded. i mentioned that ""if"" you worked full-time, your income would be around 80k, which is not bad at all in canadian terms. yea, if we worked full-time at the ta rate of $42/h (which we don't). so you're making a point out of false assumptions and slippery slopes. &gt;if you don't know what a wage is, it is the amount of money an individual makes in a hour's worth of work; just clearing that up. we know you are limited in terms of hours, but you are still compensated very well for those hours. you have enlightened me. since you love slippery slopes, riddle me this. do you agree that a person who's compensated at the wonderful rate of $10,000 an hour - but only allowed to work an hour a year - doesn't deserve any more because $10,000 an hour is a damn good rate in canadian terms? &gt;where have i stated that you get $42/h for research? i said you get that amount for doing ta work and grading etc. i just abbreviated that to meaning ""work."" the $42 per hour was asserted in the email your own union sent to everyone in the university. i don't see where the bs unless it is your own union's bs. aha, that's where i get you, because some grad students are required to ta to make up portions of their stipend. so even in spite of ta-ing, it's only making up that $15k. even for those who can get ta income in addition to their stipend (as i would, if i were to ta), that's an additional couple of thousand a year, for actually doing the additional work - remember this is already including the full time research that we do. so in other words, we're earning what we choose to do. the problem is that the base stipend is low, and they're limiting ta hours for those that actually need the money so that we're systematically limited in terms of how much we can possibly make - even if some people may want to work more. and for fuck's sake, stop trying to make this seems like i'm speaking for the union. i'm not even a part of it. &gt;i never knew people that were so gracious to hand out $24.5k like your supervisor. all those external grants have to go through the university. the university greatly facilitates people to acquire these grants and see them, including an environment where that money can be put to work. you clearly have never tried to apply for a grant before, nor have you any clue what it's like to work in a research lab, or how the funding situation works. it seems my post that addresses all your points have been in vain. touche. &gt;this directly contradicts the fact you said that the university does not fund your research. if they gave you an extra 3k, they funded your research. the university has every right to take money from your award when you are operating on its facilities. do you think that these facilities are free? the grant would help pay for that and other costs. the funding source awarded me $35k. i'm getting $27.5k. simple arithmetic would suggest you are full of shit. &gt;again, if you want to get a degree from u of t, you need to pay tuition like every other ""student"". you have to pay for these costs just like everyone else. if you want a degree, then yes, you will be a ""student"" and do research, which is part of your degree. it is not labour. it is part of what you invest as part of your education which is why no one should pay you to do what you actually need to do to earn a degree. yet, they give you 3k extra anyways. ok. let me make this clear. we are labelled as students. tuition isn't inherently linked to being a student much like how being intelligent isn't necessarily an inherent quality of being able to post on reddit. this can be about not paying tuition, or it can be about being compensated properly for the work we do after paying tuition. the bottom line for the university is the same. if they paid us 24k and we pay 9k tuition, we get 15k. what i'm asking is if the university paid us 33k and we pay 9k tuition, we'd have 24k - a much more appropriate income that's not below the poverty line. does this make you feel better? we still pay tuition just like you, but now we can actually be compensated properly for the work we do. &gt;this is why you are going on strike; you want more $$ at the end of the day. whether it be a better funding package or better wages, it's all about the $$. you must admit it, it's not about anything else. well, if you work more than full time in a specialized, technical field that not many people can contribute to while earning $15k a year, you'd probably want better pay too. no one's denying that. &gt;of course they do, but you are not workers in canada working full time, so how is your argument holding water here? we are not officially workers as grad students. what we do is equivalent to full time work. besides, this union doesn't just involve grad students. learn about sessional instructors at uoft and how shafted they are. &gt;you need to understand that tuition goes to so much more than just profs and courses. look at the operating expenses for uoft. see: salary for faculty and staff. i never said those were the only things, but they are large expenses that your tuition covers. &gt;apparently a university education is equivalent to job training according to you. following your logic, since undergrads are also being trained in their respective disciplines by learning, we should not pay the university any tuition. why would we pay for our employer (u of t) money to train us? i hope you can see where you don't make sense. research is part of your education and your degree, you have to pay for the opportunity to do it! the piece of paper is more important that for what you value it. it is a symbolic representation and certification of the human capital within you. it gives representation to something intangible and invaluable. i love how you keep equating undergrad studies to graduate studies. shows how much you know. i've spoken volumes about this, and so have others. if you refuse to accept something you have no knowledge about from people who do, then you're beyond redemption. &gt;i don't see how stating that the university is a non-for-profit is outlandish when it is true. this means that any net income will go towards funding the next year of expenditures. there's not some evil ceo or owner as you make it seem that benefits from leftover money in the end. what's ironic here is that you gave a number for ""total endowment."" endowments are only traditionally given to non-for-profits. you own evidence contradicts your claims. they say ignorance and naivety is bliss. &gt;right, and this points out to anyone reading this why the union and you have this pre-conceived notion that you are somehow deserving of more when you have a lot. i'm not saying u of t is always right, but in this instance you are wrong. how are we as undergrads different in terms of being students just like you are. you are still at educational institutions like us and paying tuition like us. we face the same issues in terms of living expenses and income problems too. you just want to convince others that you are different when you really aren't. and considering we will end up forking up more money to pay for your endeavors, we have a vested interest to make sure you don't get more because you don't need it. let me get this straight... you want to convince yourself that in your 4 years of undergrad, you can leave the same impact for the university that graduate researchers do over their time here. see above.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}",No struggles found,,1

175,"well, this is certainly a difficult issue. i guess it depends what you are talking about. the college environment or the actual benefits of having a degree which can be debated for days. overall, i had a good college experience. by that i mean, there were a lot of nice people in my doorm. all the frat house type guys were just that, frat house people, who lived on the other side of the campus. people who lived in the doorms seemed like normal folks to me. again, i will use that term loosely. of course, there were weird people. i just mean there were a lot of down to earth people. i made new friends pretty easily. if you live in the doorms, it is inevitable. i did two years of community college before going to a ""real"" school. i transferred to a four year school after that. so i came in as a junior. also, i skipped my senior year to start community college earlier. i was a 19 year old junior at the four year school. i graduated two years later one month before turning 21. i'm 23 now and i don't think college has helped. i got an international affairs degree. i didn't have a lot of concrete plans. but my parents and everyone else was really vocal about me going to school. honestly, i think i went to school too early. most people graduate at the age i am now. i should have taken more time to decide carefully. unfortunately, my parents did not really care what i was doing as long as i was out of the house. they are divorced now which makes things worse. i got kicked out of the house in feb 2012 with a only a part time job. my sister got to stay at the house. my mom was on a man hating train apparently. i languished in unemployment for months. now, i am supposed to go to korea next month for a teaching job. ironically, this was something i was looking into doing after i graduated. looking back, i wish i would have done it sooner. the only problem is now i have no clue what to do after teaching for a year. the frustrating thing is, even though i don't think my degree is very valuable, i have a friend who has no degree but finds jobs left and right. he has a lot of connections through his dad. and his dad just opened up a new business so he quit his slave job to go work for his dad. just like that. so even though i do have a degree, i feel like i should be able to still find some kind of job. but i think it is difficult for two reasons. one is that entry level jobs are down for every industry if not just gone entirely. you probably have heard this already. companies want a candidate to literally match every description on their magical checklist. i can vow for this to. i had job lined up in late june to be a delivery driver for a medical supplies company. after the interview, they invited me to have a test run with one of their employees. basically, its a ride along just to get a feel for the job. well, it turns out the job itself is complete crap. $10 dollars an hour for the first three months (it then switches to 11 something) to be on call every day and deal with insane people, freaks and or nut jobs. a lot of the people who need these supplies are in bad shape. others live in sketchy places in town. i'm like whatever. its fine. i'm about to be hired and then suddenly the owner decides he doesn't want to hire anyone. he wants someone from within the company who was recovering from an injury to pick up the slack instead. so the situation goes from being hired to not being hired. i try to keep in touch with the guy. i'm trying to express my interest that i still want the job. this whole time, he keeps saying how they don't usually hire guys with college degrees and all this stuff. eventually, he just tells me that he doesn't know what he wants to do. i don't know if they hired anyone now. i started to look overseas after that. however, that leads into my second reason. college degrees can be a hindrance. i have first hand knowledge of it. i hear a lot of people say how a degree can never hurt you. that is flat out not true. a degree can hurt you more ways than one. a degree tells people what your interests are. its like a first impression when you walk into an interview. the same applies with your degree. if you have a degree in something that does not really line up with the job position/industry it will most likely look odd. that being said, i have had interviews for places that did not involve my degree. but it is possible that some employers will either be confused by it or turned off. case in point, the medical supplies job. the guy was just convinced that i would be called up by the state department or something the next week. so i don't know what degree you are doing. there are plenty of people who have degrees that went on and did totally different things. you should not feel like being stuck. however, it seems people have success with degrees when they really know what they want out of it. having a plan matters. but its hard to have one when you don't know what you want to do. i think society pushes people into college way too early. you could get away with just any degree in the 50's. not so anymore, not to mention how expensive it is. and its even harder to recover today because of the debt. so i would say that the degree definitely matters, although i hear there are plenty of unemployed engineers as well.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}",No

180,"i just hit the random button and found your post. dude. you are me 25 year ago. i had the same underachiever grades with few extras and no sports. i barely graduated high school and my parents barely noticed. i bumped to my state school (ku) for 2 years with no direction and jerky grades - at the time all residents got in automatically. i then left for california to start all over. long story short. i had no material direction in my life when i was young and no pressure to really do anything and it was reflected by idiot grades and a lot of time wasted. it took me 10 years of aimless college until i barely graduated with a physics degree from cal, but with terrible grades - 2.8 gpa. it took 3 strong years of community college work (4.0 gpa) to just have the math to transfer. in sciences you need to do graduate work which means top grades and really understanding math. most serious grad programs want a non-terminated master meaning phd, so a bs in hard science is just the starting point. computer science is just as hard and frankly if you are not writing apps or games now you are not likely going to be a competitive programmer in the future compared with your peers. besides, you are competing with china and india for a simple job so you are not going to learn how to be a millionaire in programming class. coders are a dime a dozen. my advice. if you were my kid. you already fucked up. scared yet? it's not totally your fault. you are a kid and your parents should have been around to keep you focused. if you have drug or booze problems or you are poor or have family problems then just chalk it up to ""life sucks"" and get ready to get your ass in gear. nobody is coming to help you except yourself! it is better you realize this painful truth now than 10 years later - that video games, porn and bad food gets you nowhere and stupid. if you can't make a 3.5 gpa in college you are wasting your time in college - regardless of the major. college workload is way easy compared to life. try college for a semester and work a job at the same time. do not take crazy loans out. take all the grants you can and take loans only if you can convert them to workstudy and work at the university - its the best thing you can do for your resume, work experience and money. this is so important that i am writing this in giant fucking letters. you can graduate college without any student loan debt. do not be a debt slave - $40+k in debt only to graduate to a $8/hr job - this is killing american youth today. this is extremely important for your early life. don't think you are smart if grandma is paying your way. if you can't do it on your own something is wrong and you will continue to make lazy choices. don not go to these ""for-profit"" colleges like itt, phoenix, or chapman - they are a ripoff. if you can take 15 hours of course work your first semester and keep a 3.5 gpa, then i would say you are scared straight - stay in college. otherwise, time to start visiting the military recruiters. the best thing for a young person is some job skills and travel. the air force is the pickiest, but has the best duty stations. only take a military job if it leads to a security clearance. you sound smart enough to do that. if you interested in ""business"" pursue a cpa while in school - look up you state's licensing requirements. then pursue an mba or better a jd. jd is a very good education goal. you can cause all kinds of trouble with a jd and you don't even have to practice law. most corporate biz folks have a background in accounting/finance. get a part time job in a bank - handle money and don't get a criminal record. find a list of the top 100 corporations in the world by assets or sales and look at their on-line jobs. that is the kind of entry level/internship you are looking for. it would be very good to take the dale carnegie training course. that will carry you for your whole life. sit down a write up a plan to graduate in 4 years. do not play around with double undergrad majors - nobody cares. do not be a 5-6 year college loser. chances are you are not going to transfer between 4 year schools. hunker down and finish your bachelors with flying colors and then transfer to a ""better"" school for graduate studies. if you are going to hide out in college, regardless of what you do (and you will change your mind) - plan on going to law school, medical school or becoming a phd in engineering/sciences. that way you understand how important your grades are so you can go do cooler things after your undergraduate degree. remember keep a 3.5 gpa. it's easy. just put in the time. if you have the grades you can transfer anywhere you want, but everything starts with your first semester. the other important thing about college - the thing people won't tell you now is that is an important time to make lasting friendships with other people. these relationships - spouse, business partner, golf buddy, future job are just as important as ""grades."" there is an trite phrase - ""it's not what you know, but who you know."" college is also about making friends/opportunities for life. if you are not making friends in college something is wrong and you are on the road to become a serial killer. life is better when you are not a serial killer. every class, sit in the front row. turn to the person on the right and introduce yourself and extend your hand. turn to the left and do the same. look behind you and do the same. learn to smile and say a persons name when you look them in the eye. people like to hear their names. this is how you turn strangers into friends and allies. don't freak out if i said anything to weird. this is just some stream of consciousness. remember, i already made these mistakes so you don't have to. you have an amazing journey in front of you. it's ok to make mistakes, but you have to learn from them. learn from your lousy gpa and understand that only you are preventing yourself. don't be afraid. like they say in 'dune' - ""fear is the mind killer."" you are not going to have lasting friendships with your high school friends. people move on. you will see them over summer, then a few at christmas and then at the 1 or 2 year high school reunion. after that, people start having kids, moving away and that is life. don't get hung up on your ""failures"" and their ""successes."" trust me, the prettiest girl will be knocked up by some clown and the captain of the football team will be selling used cars down by the river. the 20 year reunion will be worth going to. you can do anything in this life. the purpose of your life is to find joy in apprehending your life. it's all inside of you.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['financial struggles', 'psychological struggles', 'social struggles', 'efforts to improve situation', 'outcomes of those efforts']",,2

193,"i saw this post and even though it's late, i want to give you my thoughts just to get another perspective, and share a little about what i went through. i'm currently a senior in high school. to give some background, my father and mother divorced when i was 13 and that put him in huge amounts of debt. to this day he works crazy number of hours in order to support me, my two siblings, my mother, and her parents. he graduated from the local community college and my mom didn't even finish her high school education. when high school started for the first two years i skipped school, didn't do my homework, and often didn't even get up to eat until well into the afternoon. my dad has always had an "" i trust you know what you're doing"" attitude when it came to me and school, and i took advantage of it. however, the summer between sophomore and junior year, i realized how badly i had fucked up, and how through all of this, my dad did everything he could to support me and encourage me despite my behavior. put simply, yes, i felt an immense amount of pressure to succeed for my father. a combination of guilt, pain, regret, and a knowledge of our financial situation has driven me to work hard in order to pay my father back for everything he has given me. he is actually not my biological father, and adopted me when he found me and my mother in the philippines. i owe everything to him. when i started improving in junior year i decided that i actually wanted to have a future and go to college, and my dad supported me. he even said that because his father never paid for his college, he would do everything he could to make sure i got to go where i wanted to, even if he had to take out loans to make it happen. he paid for tests, extracurricular trips, a computer etc. whatever would improve my chances. whenever i expressed doubt whether the money was worth it, he just said that "" it's fine, it's for your education"". this coupled with everything else only increased the pressure and motivation i had to do well. when my senior year started, i really felt that pressure even more. every sat, act, essay, or college interview was for him now. i saw it as my ""job"" as a son to pay him back for the all of the emotional and financial ""investment"" that he put in me even when i was at my lowest. it was my duty. it came to a point where i pinned the cost of my top choice (which had great financial aid) on my wall so when i did work i knew what the goal was. when decisions rolled around and i got rejected from that school, telling him was one of the hardest things i had to do. i felt like a complete failure. he even paid for me to visit that university. all of that investment wasted, and it was because i wasn't good enough. when i told him, he didn't sound disappointed at all, and told me that ""it's okay, there are other options"". this was the lowest point in the whole college decision process, because i truly did feel that i failed him as a son. in the end, it worked out because one of the colleges that accepted me offered a full ride, and in that way i feel that i fulfilled my ""obligation"". i know some may disagree with the view that i had, or why i had it. the fact remains that in my last two years, i pushed myself to do the best that i could, because i felt that it was my responsibility to my father. i plan on continuing this trend into college, and after that, so i can make sure that in his retirement he wants for nothing. sorry for this giant wall of text, but i wanted to let you know that you are definitely not alone in this. i feel like it is a common feeling among first generation or financially burdened students. hope everything works out on your end. **tl:dr** financial situation and pseudo first generation student resulted in an immense pressure to succeed and get a ""full ride"" for my father.",{'background': []},"['financial struggles', 'pressure to succeed', 'guilt', 'pain', 'regret', 'knowledge of our financial situation', 'emotional and financial investment', 'failure as a son', 'not good enough', 'waste of investment']",,2
194,"&gt; i'll be missing out on the best experience of my life. this is the biggest lie that colleges use to cash in big time. most kids go off to school and it's the first time they're away from their parents, without a lot of supervision, and they're at something that feels a lot like a summer camp. many of their perceptions about college are ill-informed by television, movies, and exaggerated images that schools are working very hard to propogate. this is the product of **the college experience.** i have news for you, it doesn't exist. there is no unifying ""college experience"" and not everybody is having the time of their lives. some people are. in fact, i had a lot of fun in college, but i don't allow myself to think back to it and only remember the positives. there was a lot of stress, isolation, frustration, and times when i was downright scared. as somebody who worked in the mental health department in my school, i know this is actually a much more common experience than college being one big party. plenty of kids were stressed out, alone, not making friends, struggling with classes, had serious financial trouble, developed drug / alcohol problems, had unwanted pregancies, and almost all of the students i worked with felt like their problems were exacerbated because they had the impression that everyone was having the greatest time of their lives and they weren't getting it. i remember particularly feeling very depressed because i was worried that i was taking out more money in loans than i could ever pay back and was worried that i wouldn't be able to get a job afterwords (i come from a very low income family). long story short, most of the people i knew from college ended up working the same jobs they were before they even graduated high school, and i've been struggling to find work above entry level positions since. if you can manage to get a degree without debt, you're going to be much less stressed out than your peers. also, you should probably note that social media like facebook is a *very* disingenuine way to gauge how awesome someone else's life is. in fact, that's why increased social media use is almost [universally correlated to depression](ýçùþ£¤êüåøþúîâæàéåêüéç£öôûçäöîïñ¡âøé×æ£èçúòþ¡ìûþëõøøçýôß¢üøòõàüóõäúâõúê¡èôé). mainly, my point is don't believe the hype. to answer your question, i would have spent four years going from class to solitary confinement if that meant i didn't have the debt. my bigger concern for you is that you might not be able to get a good job depending on your school and the program you're in whenever you get out. a lot of people in this subreddit don't want to believe this (and most of them are still in college and haven't entered the workforce yet, so why would they?), but employers almost always hire to the school and not the student. there are exceptions, but the numbers seem to indicate that maybe a not so great student from a more expensive or reknown school is going to get a job quicker than a great student from not so expensive or reknown school. case in point, most graduate schools won't look at students from penn tech's electronics and computer engineering technology program but they'll take penn state students from the same program in a heartbeat. the stupid thing is that penn tech has the same math and arguably a much better cirriculum, especially considering that you're spending four years making stuff actually work instead of just studying theory. plus, your class sizes are smaller and there's opportunities to actually do research as an undergrad because there are no grad students there. it doesn't matter though, because penn state is considered to be one of the best engineering programs in the country, and people interpret graduates from this program as if it inherently speaks to their academic prowess. my point is that this isn't always true, and there's plenty of students from penn tech who know their shit in engineering technology way better than some penn state students do. still, penn state kids will likely get hired or get into better graduate schools. i was accepted into a mini-ivy in the northeast and was extremely excited about it, but didn't go because they didn't accept the gi bill. i went to a state school instead, and couldn't get a job as easily as my friends who went off to other schools of a greater pedigree. my final point would be that, as somebody with two degrees and an honorable military discharge, you're probably going to be cultivating *way* more character and responsibility through even a two year enlistment than you would from going to graduate school. people will probably quibble and downvote this, but the amount of stress and responbility involved is not even comparable. when i was in college i had finals, friend drama, and money to worry about. when i was in the military, i had to worry about deployment, friends getting blown into pieces, getting injured (which happened), weapons safety, not getting killed, isolation to a brick building in the desert miles away from even the nearest grocery store (with no car), getting up and running two miles every morning at 5:30, and my superiors having a constant dick-waving competition to see who's the most macho guy in the room (screaming and bravado ad nauseum). at least in college, somebody trying to kill you is atypical. but that's just my experience.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['financial trouble', 'developed drug/alcohol problems', 'unwanted pregnancies', 'isolation', 'stress',

195,"i'll share my story since you asked. personally i feel a lot of animosity towards the fact that your family *could afford* to save and pay for your college. it sounds to me like you come from a decent income family and probably went to a high school that helped prepare you for college. none of that was available to me or any of the people i grew up with (the median income in the area is like $13,000 a year if that says anything). most people from my area *would kill* to have an opportunity to go to a nice school. most people leave my high school and go to a vocational school or join the military (and it's usually infantry or a combat mos). my point isn't to make you feel worse. my point is that you need to recognize that you have a really good opportunity that a lot of people don't get. this being said, i don't think you're as ""defeated"" as you're making yourself out to be. you had an internship, you have a good major, you picked a good school, and you have no debt. even if your grades aren't the best, you're still in a better position than most people going to college in the united states. just remember the average college graduate lives with their parents until they're 26 and a half years old with an average of $60,000 in debt. just sayin', i don't look at your scenario and say you're ""defeated."" it sounds to me like a mixture of growing up and maybe being a little burned out. so it looks like you have two options: 1. continue through school, get your shit together and finish your degree. ""i started slacking,"" ""lacking motivation,"" and ""i kept forgetting online assignments"" aren't good excuses. you can't do those things in the real world and expect to keep your job. set realistic goals, buckle down, and take advantage of the fact that you've been given a privilege that a lot of us would have killed for. maybe even go to the counseling center at your school or meet with an advisor. you're not an academic prodigy or honor student but that doesn't really matter - c's get degrees. 2. leave and go to a community college for a little while. you can do this, but there's no guarantee that your credits are going to transfer back into the school you're already in. i think this is a bad idea honestly because you have the financial resources to finish the school you're in. it probably just seems like a more appealing option to you because you're burned out and a change of scenery gives the illusion that it'll make things better (in my experience it doesn't). **tl;dr** - i don't really have sympathy for you if you had a really good school paid for by your parents and you fucked it up because you ""lack motivation,"" ""forgot online assigments,"" and ""started slacking."" a lot of us would have done anything to get into a good school and would have been way better at it than you are. college is a lot easier than the adult world and the **actual** responsibilities of having a job. this being said, you're still in a **really** good position because your school is paid for (no loans), you're still passing (and on your way to get a degree), the school is supposedly a good one (and that'll help you get a job because employers are inclined to hire to the school instead of the person), you picked a smart major, and you had a good internship. i think you probably shouldn't be so hard on yourself. buckle down in your final semester and, if you pass, you'll be on your way to a good job.",{'background': []},No struggles found,,2
196,"i've done it, even taking a full time course load. i worked 30 hours a week and volunteered 10 hours a week off campus (volunteer hours can be counted toward work hours). i also worked 20 hours a week on-campus (i have out-of-state family to support and so i had to work a lot, but hours on-campus count against you in a way). i also had a good job that i liked and paid me well, which made it feel worth it to me. i had to get letters from all of my supervisors and one of my professors who knew my situation. i had a residential job, which i think was also helpful in this process. i had demonstrated independence from my parents since i got emancipated as a teenager and my mother had passed away, which also helped make the transition a lot smoother. i switched my driver's license, car registration, voter registration, bank account records, everything, literally the day i got here--like within three hours i had them all switched. i had a lease in an apartment with no roommates (i was told that helped too) for the first nine months before i got a residential job, although i did have an out-of-state cosigner on my lease that they asked me about. electric/cable/internet in my name, etc. i still also had to submit a narrative explaining why i came out here and show acceptance letters to other schools that were ranked more highly in my program as well as demonstrate that it had literally been three years since i was eligible for in-state tuition at a comparable institution in *any* state (it's remarkably easy to fall through those cracks). it's much, much easier if you take a year off and work at least 30 hours--not being in classes at all is a huge convincing point. more than anything, it's important to know that while there are regulations, these are real people who are screening your application, and they have more discretion than you might expect in which applications get approved. be nice to them, be respectful, and recognize that you do have to be convincing because these people are professionals who are paid to ensure that those who deserve in-state tuition (according to regulations they don't write) get it, and those who don't, don't (and they do a lot of other things too and are very busy people). it is unlikely that living with your family will be adequate, since many students who come from out of state have family here. if you have lived with them in the past, that can help immensely. spouses are a completely different story.",{'background': ['i had to get letters from all of my supervisors and one of my professors who knew my situation.']},No struggles found,,2

201,"thanks for the congrats, here are some more details about my specific situation. 1) actually no i am not from a position of privilege. i paid for my dual credit classes through scholarships offered through the university based on need. i should also mention that it was a satellite campus of a large state college, not the main campus. i also got in-state tuition so that helped tremendously. it was only about $1,000 for 10 credit hours with the scholarships, which i paid for with my summer job. the key here is finding the right college to take your credits at that you can afford, community college is great for this as well as smaller public schools/satellite schools. 2) i have $15,000 in academic scholarships, i will get about $15,000 in financial aid per year. this leaves about $20,000 per year that i will have to pay, not including other departmental scholarships that i will attempt to win once enrolled. of course this is an insane amount money still, but that is only because i choose to go to a private school. public schools are a much better option, especially if they are in state. 3) and yes community college is still a good option, i just wanted to avoid it because my parents paid a lot of money for me to attend a private high school, i felt shitty about spending so much money in high school only to attend a community college. it was mainly personal for me.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['finding the right college to take your credits at that you can afford', 'paying for college', 'avoiding community college', 'spending money in high school only to attend a community college']",,2

203,"&gt; the point of going to college, for some people, is not simply to get a job. education is not job training, at least not for everyone, and many people care about things beyond their salaries. it sounds to me like the people you're talking about *have the luxury* to care about things beyond their salaries. &gt; that depends entirely on your career path. close to 90% of the majors in my department go to graduate school... yeah, this was my point. **sorry, but graduate school is not an employer. you're paying fucking money to be there.** making your student debt go up and sitting in school until almost your thirties is a luxury not all people can afford to do. also, i'm getting the impression you haven't seen the job prospects of people coming out of graduate schools in the liberal arts. allow me to introduce myself. i was the whiz-kid who started college really young. i was guy who was all about ""education"" over ""job training."" mr. essay-contest winner, published research in undergrad, honor student, multiple major, blah blah blah. it all amounted to nothing. after i graduated i was unemployed for years, and all of my ""high achieving"" friends are working the same jobs they did before they graduated. the ones who went off to graduate school have outstanding debt they'll never pay off, or they worked as adjunct professors in some cases up to ten years before they even got offered tenure. when i first got out of college i'd probably be furious to read this stuff, but now i understand that you come from an era that doesn't exist anymore. take a look at college grads and where we're working. look at the student loan debt in our country. see how many phds are struggling for basic work. talk about the virtues of education when tuition rates soar every single year and interest rates inflate. if i could take it all back, i **would** have got that bs in mathematics and would have begged myself not to listen to the kinds of lofty ideas i heard from professors like you because, at the end of the day, people who talk like that are people who can afford to.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['making your student debt go up and sitting in school until almost your thirties is a luxury not all people can afford to do', 'working the same jobs they did before they graduated', 'struggling for basic work', 'tuition rates soar every single year and interest rates inflate']",,2

210,"normally i'd probably say no, but i think my story (or, really, my wife's) can serve as a good warning for everyone. i'll probably wind up giving more than enough information for some of you to guess at who i am, so hello! you and i, op, actually had a couple of years overlapping. a bit of background. i met my then girlfriend, now wife, back in our senior year of high school. by the time we got serious, i was already accepted to rhit and she was already accepted to a very good school in our home state. my parents had been saving since before i was born for my education and my grandparents, thrilled that i got into a school like rhit, decided to chip in. still, my mother, being an accountant, realized that paying for rhit was probably going to bankrupt me if we weren't very careful. i was only able to get a couple of meager scholarships (i never qualified for 'need based' scholarships because, thanks to farm land that we owned, it looked like we were much better off than we were - family farms aren't money makers), so we still had to get a few loans. luckily, thanks to my mom's extensive knowledge, we were able to only get very low, fixed rate, loans. by the time i graduated, i left with about 30k in debt, not bad. amazingly, these loans are all below the inflation rate (so, paying them off quickly actually hurts me)! now, my wife, on the other hand, is a very different story. her parents had no real understanding of the financial system. should a carpenter and a teacher be expected to know as much about how things work as an accountant? anyways, to fund her first year of university (remember, not rhit), they took out bank loans with variable interest rates (this was a few years before the sub-prime crash so no one knew the dangers of this yet). after about a year, my wife decided she'd rather be at rhit (both to be with me and because the environment was better suited to her). her parents took out more bank loans. by the end of her time at rhit (since rhit took few of her credits from her previous university, she spent five years between the two of them) she had amassed nearly 200k in debt. to be fair, this covered education and housing, but i don't think she or her parents ever realized how bad things were about to get. each month, we pay about $1500.00 just for her loans (mine come in at a paltry 200 bucks). we've calculated that, given the interest rates and lack of government protection for bank loans, we will probably never be completely free of those debts. defaulting is not an option because we are honorable and because her parents are co-signers on the loans. worse, thanks to the variable interest rate, the amount of that 1.5k that goes to interest vs principle changes wildly. for a couple of years right after the sub-prime implosion we were actually going backwards each month! this kind of debt is on the high end, to be sure, but even 4 years at the ~30k a year that rhit costs is already 120k. these aren't debts, these are shackles. combined, we make a decent living, but most of her salary is consumed by debt payments. we will probably never be able to purchase our own home. we want kids, but we have no idea how we could ever afford them. if either of us lost our job, we'd be in serious trouble. i can't afford to start a business that i'd like to start. we even considered not getting married at one point so that we wouldn't both be saddled with the debt... the education i got and the environment in which i got it was second to one and, to be honest, my wife and i wouldn't be married today had it not been for our time together. none the less, i will likely never donate to rhit; how can i when i will forever be an indentured servant to a bunch of banks? i was listening to a financial program the other day that made the point that easy access to student loans didn't cause education to become more affordable, but just gave the schools an incentive to raise prices. students no longer had to pay for things immediately, so why not get as much out of them as possible? it is a horrendous injustice that student loan debt has outpaced credit card debt. i'm sorry, this reply was way too long for what could have just been two numbers.",{'background': ['My parents could no longer afford to keep me fed with a roof over my head']},"['amassed nearly 200k in debt', 'will probably never be completely free of those debts', 'going backwards each month', 'consumed by debt payments', 'lost our job', 'cannot afford to purchase our own home', ""cannot afford to start a business that i'd like to start""]",,2

227,"&gt; ""why would i let you get a job when you aren't even working towards your degree yet?"" you could always counter that she doesn't have to pay for the degree; you could pay it yourself by getting a job. i have two personal stories for you, that may make you feel better. (1) i stayed at home for the entirety of my undergraduate studies due to immigration and financial issues at the time. there was an option for me to attend another university a bit farther away, but i was convinced by my family that i was ""not ready to live on my own"" and thus didn't pursue this option. i realized that i was avoiding to go home as much as possible to avoid interacting with my family. i didn't have a driver's license because i couldn't get a car, and there limited public transit opportunities available to me living in that area. the result was that i ended up missing out on a lot of social interactions and opportunities, and asking to be able to go out was just a pain in the neck. i dreaded trying to do any kind of opportunity that required travel somewhere outside of the town, since most often the answer would be no. i didn't even feel like getting unpaid internships because distance and housing would just raise so many complications. i didn't realize how insane this situation was until i left the town/country to pursue graduate studies as a financially independent individual, and it was the best decision i made, and one i wish i had made much sooner. (2) my brother wasn't entirely as lucky academically as me. he dropped out of high school, attempted remedial coursework twice before dropping out, attempted homeschool, and finally got a ged. my mom was understandably quite devastated, and convinced he was not ready to do anything, except school. it took a lot of convincing on my part that finding work would be beneficial to him, where he could easily see his contribution/effort while saving up for an eventual degree. (it helped that we had a precedent in the family of an uncle who worked minimum wage jobs until age 30, where he got a bsc then phd, then immediately became a prominent scientist). so he ended up working at a manual labor job for 2 years, before he got sick of the situation and decided to leave to pursue an ee degree (at age 22). my goal now is to convince my parents that yes, my brother is perfectly equipped for living on his own, and if not he will figure it out since he is not a complete idiot. so i guess the message here is that, yes, you will need to have an uncomfortable conversation with your parents. perhaps you should talk to your dad first privately, explain the situation, and figure out how to approach mom. education is important, but you're still very young and have a lot of time to work through it. you're only wasting time by following instructions that are ultimately detrimental to your life and career. make them realize that university is hard, university is not like high school, and actually you're an adult and you're not at all required to show them your university scores, your health record, or really tell them anything about what's going on in your life. a lot of people are suggesting you work and then rent a place in kw. while this is good advice, it is unreasonable to make this actionable immediately for next term. find some friends who are willing to let you crash with them for a short while until you are able to get yourself back on your feet as a financially independent individual. if you can't find anyone, pm me and i'll try to help.","{'background': ['i, however, am poor']}","['stayed at home for entirety of undergraduate studies due to immigration and financial issues', 'limited public transit opportunities available to me living in that area', 'asking to be able to go out was just a pain in the neck', ""didn't even feel like getting unpaid internships because distance and housing would just raise so many complications"", 'dropped out of high school, attempted remedial coursework twice before dropping out', 'homeschool', 'ged', 'work at manual labor job for 2 years', 'sick of the situation and decided to leave to pursue an ee degree', 'not wasting time by following instructions that are ultimately detrimental to your life and career', ""not required to show them university scores, health record, or really tell them anything about what's going on in your life""]",,2

""there have been a handful of occasions on when i have felt that life was no longer worth living and that it would be in everybody’s (including my own) best interest if i died. the only thing that has kept my spirit alive is the knowledge that i have a disabled mother and a little sister who depend on me and, more than that, they love me unconditionally and have seen me through some of the darkest times of my life. you see, i don’t just struggle with depression, i also struggle with mania- i have bipolar disorder and i am not alone. i am one of the 4.4% of americans who also struggle day-to-day with bipolar disorder. there is no cure, there are no secret treatment options, the only way to cope is to face it head-on and do whatever you must to defeat it. one of the hardest parts of being mentally ill (besides the actual symptoms, of course) is the constant stigma of being mentally ill. anyone who says there is no stigma towards those who are mentally ill is an ignorant fool. in 2006/2007 i finished my freshman year of college at ********* state college. i decided to transfer to ********** college for the rest of my collegiate career since it was closer to my home and much closer to my work. my first year at ********** went well. during this time i started sporadically experiencing anxiety here and there but i basically ignored it because in the spring of 2009 i was focused on one thing: the london school of economics. i was determined to attend one of their summer programs on the middle east and global politics. thanks to my gpa and some glowing letters of recommendation from two of my political science professors i was accepted! the opportunity to study with people with a wide variety of opinions and global perspectives was very interesting. it was also a bit humbling to know that a lot of great men and women graduated from lse so even just attending the summer program was an honor. with the exception of my underlying mental illness, up to this point my life probably seems like it was heading in the right direction. but something happened around the time that i went to london that really shifted my focus from a holiday in london to life or death. in 2001, when i was 12 years old, my mother was diagnosed with lupus. her second husband (my stepfather) had committed suicide two years prior, he was bipolar was well. this caused me to grow up, so to speak, very quickly. from a very young age i took it upon myself to take care of my mother and sister, that’s why it was so hard to go to london even though my mother had been diagnosed two weeks prior with breast cancer. i refused to leave her side while she was being treated vowing to be there for every chemotherpy treatment, i was determined not to go to london but, in typical mom fashion she said she would “never forgive me” if i didn't go. i did as my mom said. after i returned from london my depression, which had waxed and waned over the years, began to cripple me and my anxiety became uncontrollable. i have always had problems with social anxiety, but now i would try to go to class and would end up sitting in my suv, in the parking lot, crying, not really sure why. i reached out for help to both my school and my psychiatrist. they both did the best they could under the circumstances, withdrawing me from classes and constantly adjusting my medications to try and find the right ’cocktail’. by this time i was about 22 and my psychiatrist had decided that my depression, anxiety, and other symptoms were actually a severe case of bipolar disorder. i've worked all of my life from the time i was able to get a work permit. i first worked in a movie theater for three years moving up the chain from concessions to cook (the highest paid hourly position). i then cross-trained as a bartender and my interest in bartending led me to a ********* job fair. unfortunately, the bartender positions were all filled, but they had openings for a banquet supervisor and thus began my career in banquet management. i was 18, i had no idea what i was doing and just prayed i didn't mess up things up too bad at first. i was about as green as green could be as far as catering experience. luckily i am a fast learner and i worked with a great team. i managed dozens of staff and ran events such as dinners, proms, graduations, and helped with backstage catering for concerts and other major events. i spent two years at the ********* and in that time i learned a lot about leadership and problem solving in the real world. it’s one thing to solve a complex problem in a textbook, it’s a whole other ballgame when you’re trying to solve a complex problem in the real world. even though my career in banquets/catering was looking bright i yearned to finish my degree. i had one problem, i still had the social anxiety and with that came social paranoia, the insane idea that everyone is looking at you and talking about or judging you. sometimes you know how ridiculous it is but the physiological feeling is real, you can‘t deny it, but you can learn to control it. i spent almost a year in behavioral modification therapy trying to work through my anxiety and learning to cope in situations where i feel anxious. i was feeling very optimistic about the treatment until it was time to go back to school in the fall. i’m not really sure what happened to me, the anxiety quickly resurfaced with vengeance and my worst fear had been realized: i was not going to finish this semester. i had failed. i drove off the ********** campus ashamed, humiliated and demeaned all because i couldn't handle a little anxiety. i went back to work at the ******** where i excelled and became very respected by the staff despite my very young age. after my employment at the *********** i began working as the assistant banquet manager for the ************ hotel. i worked 45-55 hours a week ensuring the banquet department ran smoothly on a day-to-day basis and any scheduled events went off without a glitch. i had to learn to do every job you can imagine: a client need's a last minute projector, i am there to set it up; a fight in the parking lot, i have to call the cops and try to separate them; a client is unhappy with her wedding setup so i get to be her verbal punching bag for a few hours. i did everything from dishwasher to watching over the entire hotel during my manager on duty shifts. so here i am. i've fed 2,000 church goers, i've fed 3,000 dunkin’ donuts employees, i've fed rock stars, but now i feel like it’s time to get back to feeding my brain. i have been working with both my therapist and my medication specialist for a very long time. i have always felt like a piece of me was missing without my degree. i have a very deep interest in history, politics, international affairs and economics, i know i would excel at your institution. luckily bipolar disorder is very treatable with proper medication and therapy. i have made mistakes; how many can be attributed to my mental illness, i don’t know. i have been very fortunate to have a solid support team, without my mother and sister i can only hazard a guess as to what my fate would have been. growing up they would always tell me how smart i am and how proud they are of me and i was always afraid of letting them down. as one of my favorite fellow bipolar sufferers, stephen fry, once said, “having a great intellect is no path to being happy”. i agree, i have found that happiness comes from within; it comes from the satisfaction of providing for my family, it comes from the joy i get in seeing my dog run to greet me when i get home from work and hopefully one day the happiness will come when i proudly look at my bachelor’s degree framed in my living room in defiance of any chemical imbalance i may have. i realize it will take time, if i have to take a course a semester until i get my degree then that’s what i’ll do. in a way i feel incomplete, like i failed to live up to a certain standard i set for myself a long time ago. granted, there were certainly extenuating circumstances: my mother’s illness, my own mental health and caring for my younger sister but i still feel like i should have been able to handle it. so here we are, here to finish what i started almost seven years ago. it’s taken a lot of therapy, self-reflection, medication adjustments, and life style changes that got me to the point where i could even consider going back to school. i am blessed to have a great family that fully supports me and medical professionals who want to see me flourish instead of fail. i feel earning my degree would expand my job prospects and would be a huge step in both my life and my treatment.""",{'background': []},No struggles found,,2
243,"haha yeah, i spent several years trying to get to their level, but it's hard to compete with them. in the end, though, i've had to realize that trying to equal their prowess is pointless. instead, i should use them as inspiration. take my dad for example. he grew up in a poor neighborhood in oxnard, california. when he was ten, his dad, the breadwinner of the family, walked out on his family, leaving his degree-less mom to take care of him and his younger brother. my dad realized early on that his mom was struggling to take care of everyone, so by the time he was thirteen, he was working and taking care of his five year old brother, and when he was sixteen, he was working two. his mom and brother were the most important things to him, and he wanted them to be as comfortable as possible. so he convinced his mom to take less hours at her job and take care of his brother, letting my dad work the majority of the hours. still, it wasn't a lot of money. just enough to live on (i've said this on reddit before, but my dad's graduation dinner was him and his mom splitting a burger and fries at carl's junior. he likes to spoil my grandma now, letting her get her own meal from carl's whenever he sees her). from a young age, my dad was sure that the only way he could get him and his family out of poverty was if he went to college. so he went to work in school, and made sure he got good enough grades to get a scholarship. but he didn't get the scholarship. he went to the cheapest school he applied to, passing up offers from princeton and uchicago. there was no way he could pay for school, though, so he took out all the loans he could to get his degree, which took him years and years to pay off. every month, my grandma would send him 100$, and he would secretly give it to his brother, so his mom wouldn't be wasting money on him. he got his degree in geology and went to work. once again, he worked his ass off, sending all the money he could to his family, with the rest going towards his living, still in poverty. he had had enough, so he told his mom he'd have to stop sending her money for a little while while he saved for grad school. he worked until he was 28,when he finally got enough cash to send his family, his wife and yours truly, to dallas, where he went to smu on a scholarship. he knew that geology wouldn't get him enough money to have all of his family be comfortable, so he got his mba. from there, he used his experience in the field, in addition to his business knowledge, to get a job in the energy field. nearly fifteen years of ass-busting later, he's the cfo of a decent-sized oil company. he still sends money to his mom. a few weeks ago, he bought her an entirely new kitchen, because hers was out of date. finally, after twenty years of work, he can support everyone in his family (his brother used the same philosophy, and turned his love of fashion into his own fashion company). this is what i want to emulate. my dad had every reason to fail, every reason to stay in the poor neighborhood and work three jobs, getting his mom just enough money to survive. but he saw what needed to be done, and did it. he bet on himself, and trusted that with enough work, he could break out of oxnard and make himself into something. i look at all my dad didn't have, and all i have, and i see no reason to be complaining about equaling him. all i can do is work as hard as he did, and hope the cards fall my way. my dad was incredibly lucky, but he believes you can make your own luck. i believe that too. i know i probably won't equal his accomplishments, but i would be shaming him by not at least giving it a shot. hope that sums it all up. in the end, your parents are completely different from you, and all you can do is work hard and harder than they did, and maybe you have a shot at passing them.","{'background': ['My dad grew up in a poor neighborhood in Oxnard, California.

251,"ah okay. yup i understand, i didnt know any of this when i started either! i learned as i went. i was just curious where you got the number from so i could understand your situation better. i dont think the fafsa counts in specific debt. just their income. they compare it to the us poverty line levels and take into account ""normal"" expenses and some other hullabaloo in their formula, and spit out a number that they think your family should be able to pay. if your parents are married, you need to provide both of their incomes. if not, just provide one parents income. im not sure of what is considered ""poor enough"" if your area, but im willing to bet youll at least get the majority of it covered. and your senior year, once you yell happy new years! go and fill out your fafsa. well, at least, as soon as everyone that works gets their w2 (including you, and like i said, parents). and definitely do it before march 1. i think two hours is too much, honestly. i had a house i could have commuted from too that was two hours away. but i instead elected to sleep on my ex boyfriends floor in an apartment with roommates i wasnt too fond of. the commute can be taxing. but it depends on your schedule. a two hour commute twice a week isnt bad. everyday starts to wear on you, and you have less time to study, and no social life. the grace period is automatic. you have six to nine months depending on the loan. when you get your loans and accept them (through the university aid portal) youll be directed to sign an mpn and probably take ""entrance counseling"". through those youll learn all about your interest rates and it will tell you your automatic grace period and give you contact information about consolidation afterward and everything. i think your major is smart, both have strong job markets. i think somewhere someone said not to take loans that outdo your first year salary, and you should be okay on that, seriously. but your earning potential is strong, so you have a little wiggle room. loans suck, but theyre necessary sometimes. honestly, in your situation, well, i honestly sort of was in your situation, i lived in the dorms my first year. i dont think it was worth the money but it just really depends on you. some people i know loved their dorm experience. others just found an apartment the first year. but if you think you really wont mind the commute and saving the money is important, then do that. honestly, you can wait to make some of these bigger decisions until you get your financial aid report. youll need to inform fafsa what you want to do re: housing, if youre leaning toward dorm, then put that. if youre leaning toward on campus even just a little, do that. it can always be changed later, but you should see what they give you with housing included before switching it to commuting. i did that for this year, and i had more than enough for housing, but decided to commute anyway, and they just reduced my aid to the max amount i could possibly get for a commuting student with a 0 efc. no out of pocket, just about 2 k in loans. at this point, make a list of pros and cons about dorm vs apt vs commuting, and talk to your parents about it. honestly, im nearly certain you arent going to get screwed out of funding, but do some research. for example, harvard kids with home incomes under 60 get full rides (i think). my parents income is waaaay lower than that, and i have loans. see if you can find any information about financial aid levels for your state.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor', 'My parents could no longer afford to keep me fed with a roof over my head', 'My family could never afford', None]}","['financial', 'psychological', 'physical', 'social']",,2
252,"also, don't get so ahead of yourself. see what financial aid gives you. i thought i was going to have a horrible time of college because i would be working full-time just to barely get by. i had around $400 in savings going into my senior year of high school, and i frantically worked to bring that up by myself. i sold a lot of my electronics and worked my ass off during my senior year of school and during summer working as a dishwasher (yeah, you should never *ever* do that) at a local diner. i do not qualify for *any* private loans due to my parents' bankruptcy. turns out i didn't really have to worry. i got a $7,000/year scholarship renewable for all four years from my college. on top of that, i got a $2000 scholarship from my high school (for one year). i also got a $2000 scholarship from my college (for one year). this is on top of being eligible for $5,500 in public loans (i only took $3,500 because i didn't even need it all) and $1,500 in federal work study. i also got $1000 in money from the state, $500 from a grant that most students get and $500 for my grades in high school. the state aid is renewable as well. at the beginning, i had a $20,000/year college bill. this first semester, i paid $1087.75 for my first semester. keep in mind i get $750 per semester from working through federal work study (with which i already have an awesome job lined up in the career development center which will also help me network to greatly increase job prospects after college). i only took on $1700 in debt the first semester. i could have paid $88 for a full semester of college if i decided to take all the loans offered. basically, what i'm saying is that things have a way of working out. stay optimistic and worry about your senior year of high school, not your senior year of college and beyond. work hard to save if at all possible, and reevaluate in six months. see where you are and what financial aid from the college you're looking at seems to be giving you. you may find there isn't anything to worry about.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor', 'My family could never afford']}","['financial aid', 'working full-time', ""parents' bankruptcy"", 'loans', 'debt', 'saving', 'college bill']",,2

282,"recent b.s. grad here, so i can only speak from undergrad experience. i would estimate that a huge chunk of those attending iit pay their way through using student loan debt. some receive partial scholarships (such as the heald); others get a full ride (camras, leadership academy, rotc). the school itself doesn't offer too many handouts, and i think most apply only to undergrads anyway. as far as graduate admission financial assistance goes, [this](ýçùþ£¤üîâùùèõ×õùèæâêóö×ò×øçþâóëõæ¢ùãîèþâóíæâùòëãóøþáìøüéàñ) is probably the only useful page on that topic. you have to take into account that iit is a private institution and not a state school like u of l and also smaller (taking into account main campus only). this tends to make the school's financial aid options limited. your options are probably as follows: - find a job that pays for classes as part of the benefits package. there are probably few of these in psychology compared to engineering, they only pay for 1-2 classes at a time, and you are splitting your time between work and school. iit pays for your tuition if you work for them full-time. still, you have to find that iit job and split your work/class time doing it. - save up working elsewhere in the field and then come back to school. a sound financial option, but i would imagine delaying is not something you want to do. - suck it up and take out student loans. you will probably have to ask yourself if it worth it before you do (how quickly will you find a job after school? will it pay enough to cover the debt and living expenses? is the phd going to give you a financial advantage over working now?). the school might offset some of the cost with a scholarship or two. digging around might produce some more money here and there in scholarship form. still, you are going into the red for a while, and paying more than you took out. personally, i went the student loan route, but it was due to lack of knowledge and time to decide. also, i had no other means of funding. the school gave me the heald and i think something else small. after 4 years, i racked up about $60-70k in debt and now i am paying it off. luckily, i have a well paying engineering job (my second one since graduation) and can deal with the payments without worrying too much. it was totally worth it for me. this, obviously doesn't happen to everyone. there are two ways you can probably offset a bit of the spending. first, try to find a part time job, at least for pocket money so you are not paying for entertainment and food with your loans. second, move off-campus into bridgeport. it will be cheaper than the dorms and will give you more freedom. some students rent apartments together for ~$400/person. good luck! chicago is a great city to study and live in, and you will hopefully enjoy it for the diverse experience it provides.","{'background': ['i, however, am poor', 'My parents could no longer afford to keep me fed with a roof over my head', 'I went the student loan route, but it was due to lack of knowledge and time to decide.', 'My family could never afford']}","['- find a job that pays for classes as part of the benefits package', '- save up working elsewhere in the field and then come back to school', '- suck it up and take out student loans', '- try to find a part time job for pocket money', '- move off-campus into Bridgeport']",,2

285,"you sound very entitled. but hear me out. i am in my early 20s and grew up in a broke family. i attended a college that was not a target school and i wanted to break into venture capital, one of the absolute hardest fields to break into. my first semester of school i worked at barnes and noble and my last semester of school i worked at a clothing store. but i ended up in venture capital. why? because i had a great work ethic. i rented an apartment in an extremely expensive area and even had car payments and car insurance to pay for. there are 168 hours in a week. if you live like a princess and get a full 8 hours of sleep a day, you still have 112 hours left over. assuming you are taking 16 credits a semester, you now have 96 hours left over. saying that you will not work unless it is a great networking experience at the age of 17 or 18 is insanely entitled baring in mind that you essentially have ninety six hours of spare time. 20 hour a week part time job? you still have 76 hours to network, etc. not having a job is going to encourage laziness. even beyond that, nobody is going to give you an internship in a top program if you have never had a job. it's just not going to happen. you're also not going to learn how to interact in a professional environment (yes, even at a coffee shop) and are going to grow accustomed to having a lot of free time (even if you join a few clubs). for perspective on the fact that i'm not a hypocrit, i already admitted how many bills i had to pay and my objective for a career. however, in school, i became vice president of a financial organization, started and led a student run business, was president of my greek life organization and interned each semester in addition to having a job. my final semester of school i interned at two different vcs, worked a job that paid my bills and still took 17 credits with my extracurriculars. i don't know you, but it honestly sounds like you just don't want to have a job. if you wanted to work a relevant job in the field, then you wouldn't have written a multi page post on whether or not you should get a job- you'd be applying to relevant jobs instead. i can personally say that, across the board, any 17 or 18 year old that feels he is too good/ too busy to have a job is lazy or entitled and i would never hire them. there are plenty of opportunities on campus to grab a few hours of work a week, but why would a firm hire a teenager with no academic knowledge of accounting/ finance or work experience? you haven't earned the right to be entitled yet. in two years, then you can start to be picky, but where you are right now, you are as old and experienced as high school seniors. spoiler alert: i did break into venture capital. and it wasn't from joining a lot of clubs (few major companies care about your clubs) and it wasn't from my gpa (didn't even list it on my resume) it was from the progression of work experience on my resume. every college student joins a bunch of clubs and studies. good job. no college student gets off campus and busts tables before going to their unpaid internship that gets them into conferences. you are right that networking is one of the most important things you can do, but can you honestly look someone straight in the eyes and say that spending 20 hours out of the 168 you have a week is a game changer for networking? how many networking events even happen on the weekends? i am willing and happy to answer any questions or offer any suggestions for anything that you are interested in pursuing, but if i was told that you- a teenager- had a $100/month gym membership, where you presumably spent 10 hours or so a week, but didn't have enough time/ interest to work a job, i would not only not hire you, but talk about it to colleagues. obviously, you are old enough to make your own decisions. but it looks like you just do not want to have a job and are trying your best to justify yourself. the absolute last college that should be unemployed is business and 15-20 hours a week is nothing, particularly if it takes stress off of your broke parents.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['broke family', 'expensive area', 'car payments and insurance', 'not having a job', 'lazy', 'entitled', 'no academic knowledge of accounting/finance or work experience', 'unpaid internship', 'college student joins a bunch of clubs and studies', ""didn't have enough time/interest to work a job"", 'no job', 'struggle to justify themselves']",,2

298,"i have to disagree with you when it comes to the cost of education. in this day and age, going to school is accepting debt. according to the national center for education statistics, the cost of one year of college was 1,200 in 1970. minimum wage was about 1.60. seems fair right? you had to work 750 hours a year to pay that if you worked a minimum wage job, that would be about 14-15 hours of work a week. probably less, because you would work more in the summer. i only found credible data for a 2007 calculation. cost of one year of college was about 11,000 dollars. (which about is what i am currently paying, i go to a smaller public university deemed ""affordable"" at about 12,000 for housing, tuition and fees). minimum wage hasn't gone up in a while, at 7.25 an hour, you would have to work 1520 hours a year... so about 30 hours a week. personally, i can't work more than 15 hours. my course work is too much, so i can pay approximately half my tuition by working. over the summer, i can work 28 hours when i take classes (can't work more than that... people don't like to hire college students full time because then they need to offer benefits), which adds about 2,500 towards tuition. but, this doesn't cut it. i have to still take out loans. i completely max out my government loans and i still can't cover it. so, last year, i worked 25 hours a week while going to school and it sucked. but, i can afford for now. in my field, i need at least a masters, so i have no idea what to do after undergraduate. we have to accept debt in order to get an education. students have hit 1 trillion dollars of loans. it's crazy how expensive it is. many people of past generations tell us ""it's an investment"" but some of us literally cannot make ends meet even when maxing out the investment. and, we need education to get employed. more people are going to college than before... making it more competitive for those jobs. so, in addition to working, we have to make ourselves stand out. my friends who have graduated and still are trying to find jobs are expected to start paying their loans off. how? so here we are, stuck in this catch 22. spending money to eventually make money. it's absolutely terrifying and infuriating. i find myself resenting people who can afford college, which is terrible. i also find myself resenting people who tell me that my generation just doesn't understand hard work. because we do. so from that perspective, after studying for a test for a major that will make me employable all night after working a job just so i can pay to be able to take that test... yeah, it's hard to appreciate the liberal arts gen eds.","{'background': ['i only found credible data for a 2007 calculation. cost of one year of college was about 11,000 dollars.']}","['accepting debt', 'working 15-30 hours a week', 'maxing out government loans', 'making ends meet', 'finding a job', 'paying loans off', 'resenting people who can afford college', ""resenting people who tell me that my generation just doesn't understand hard work""]",,2

325,"&gt; has anyone found the debt worth it? a lot of the answer depends on your view of debt. all my life i avoided debt except for a car. any other debt was pointless to me because it was an endless cycle. so if i didn't have the money i did not spend it. there is an idea that one cannot build wealth if they are always in debt. i agree with the logic behind that idea. for many years i worked my way through college paying as i go. it worked well because i didn't know what i wanted to major in and i wanted to live life experiences i couldn't do as a full-time student. i traveled, then worked, then worked and went to school, then traveled. all the while i thoroughly enjoyed life. i finally decided what degree i wanted and went back to school full time and worked as much as possible. for the first 1.5 years this played out nicely but my major was not working out. i changed majors and decided i wanted to push through school. in order to do that i had to get student loans. i graduated with 24,000 in loans. i had a low-paying job in my field. then my car ended up with $1,400 in repairs. then i had to have surgery on my knee, which was another $3,200. f! i was trapped. i couldn't do anything fun because of this amount of money i owed. if i had fun that cost money i couldn't enjoy it because i just got into (stayed in) debt a bit more. i couldn't get a loan to buy a car let alone anything else. it's a trap! i decided i wanted out and never be in debt again. i wrote a budget and followed it with everything i could. i paid it all off in 22 months. i felt so free. after going through all of that... debt is not worth the experience of going through college. that being said, going into debt for school depends on several factors. going for a doctorate might be quite difficult to obtain without debt. if you must go to a school that has a certain status might be quite difficult to attend without debt. otherwise, i think one can choose a school and degree that they can work to pay for while they attend. i wish that when i graduated i had a clean slate instead of a hole to climb out of.","{'background': ['i, however, am poor']}","['debt', 'financial struggles', 'trapped', 'cannot do anything fun', 'owed money', 'cannot get a loan', 'trap', 'budget', 'paying off debt', 'feeling free']",,2

339,"on the positive side, sam houston state isn't a terribly expensive school. their calculator online suggests that with no scholarships or family support, you will need to either earn or take out in loans around 16k a year (including room and board in the dorms). that is a lot, but compared to other universities not especially expensive. will you be able to keep your job as a server and live at home once you go to school? that would reduce your costs by a lot, because you would have both an income and very low living costs. if your parents and the restaurant aren't close to the university, then you probably have to spend a year in the dorms, but then you can move into an apartment with friends and save some money that way. you definitely should work your way through school--criminal justice is an easy major so you should be able to work 20 hours a week or so while a full-time student if you carefully plan your time. 20 hours a week during the school year and full-time work in the summers, if you can earn around $8-9 an hour, will result in an annual income of around 9-10k after taxes. so, maybe you will need $7k or so in student loans per year, and you can cover the rest with earned income. if you take 4.5 years to get through school, which is pretty average, you'll end up with around 32k or so in student loans. at an average interest rate of 6.8%, you can use this free [student loan payment calculator](ýçùþ£¤êüåúþáæ×é¢äåìèõáöúúæèäåøñãöáõïþáúáùáäýçòú) to see that you'll owe monthly payments of around $370 over ten years. if you only ever pay that much per month, you'll eventually have paid a total of 44k in payments. criminal justice majors have an average starting salary of around 34k, according to this [georgetown report on college majors, salaries, and unemployment rates](ýçùþ£¤êüå¢üøôàìùéâüüùùèõ×õù¢ìþõý¤ûõ××úêþéúè¢ºüêáåßôçòùãç´îâößãõøöçêäùù), which may result in a monthly income after tax of around $2,300 according to this [paycheck calculator](ýçùþ£¤êüåäöìèöê×àöîâþ¢øâòèõáöúúæèäåáæàöåþ). therefore, as you can see, you'll probably be able to afford your student loan payment so long as you get a decent job and keep your cost of living low. to illustrate why you should work, however, consider how much your student loan payments would be if you borrowed 16k every year for 4.5 years. you would end up owing 72k by the time you graduated, and your monthly payments would be a whopping $830 a month for ten years. that would be very unaffordable unless you were living at home after college and thus didn't have to pay rent.","{'background': ['I, however, am poor']}","['financial', 'psychological', 'physical', 'social']",,2

346,"i guess i'll contribute my story of sturbridge square, this will be long so i apologize in advance... i lived there 2 years ago so for all i know they may have turned things around. but it was an absolute nightmare start to finish for me. i signed the lease less than a month before moving in because i needed a place and some friends needed a roommate. i was the first to move in since i always stay in blacksburg for summer and my lease at the village was up. i showed up and the manager who seemed nice enough took me to the apartment. i immediately noticed an odd odor about the place but decided to ignore it. she showed me around and once we arrived to what would be my bedroom (the master) i noticed a cockroach on the closet door. i pointed it out and the manager 's face immediately took on an ""oh shit i'd hoped you wouldn't notice"" look. she hurriedly brushed away my concerns by saying that they were replacing the bathtub upstairs and that the cockroach had probably been disturbed by that...and also that they had had pest control in to take care of the problem earlier the same day. being naive (even though my dad's words warning that once you live in a place with cockroaches you will never never never be rid of them was ringing in my ears) and needing to put my stuff somewhere i chose to believe her. so she left and i immediately moved all my things in. i soon realized the lack of lighting in the apartment and left to go grab lamps and other essentials from target. nothing could have prepared me for what i came back to... not one, not two or three cockroaches. the place was swarming in them. i could not go into a room without seeing at least six all of varying sizes. it was very evident that this was an infestation that was definitely no where near being under control. needless to say i was not staying there that night. so i booked it out of there left an angry message for the manager and stayed at a friends house. that morning i received a call back from the manager saying that they would either let me out of the lease scott free or upgrade my roommates and i to a renovated apartment in a different building at the same price we were already paying (and of course they would have their staff help me move). i chose the latter option and after bagging up all my electronics, putting anything and everything soft through the drying on extra high heat three times (they offered free laundry back then) and getting rid of any and all cardboard i moved in. they also started using the same pest people as foxridge and had them personally assure me that they would handle the roach issue. i still found the occasional straggler from the other apartment (which led to panic attacks worrying that this apartment would also become infested) but within a couple weeks i was roach free. after that issue my neighbors became the problem. they lived in absolute filth. the maintenance men would often complain about them to me when i ran into them in the hall, from what i heard they had used toilet paper up to your knees in the bathroom. they also smoked inside leaving their cigarette butts in the hallway. they also smoked in their apartment. they smoked so much in fact that the smell and smoke began to seep into my room. i have asthma so i was getting choked up every time i walked into my home. i contacted the manager letting them know and all they did was essentially inform me that it is their right to smoke in their apartment and that there was nothing they could do. needless to say i began spending significantly less time in my apartment after that. finally, when my roommates and i were leaving they claimed that we never paid our final months rent. my roommate who was very reliable assured us that it was given to them. in this case i was more inclined to believe my roommate since i knew for a fact that they just threw rent checks willy nilly into a filing cabinet. by the time they informed us that we were ""late"" with our rent we had all moved out and i had to take a cashiers check to them and pay a late fee we never should have had to pay. these were the major issues i had and what i usually tell people interested in living there. there were the obvious issues that i think are common in every apartment like paper thin walls, or not enough kitchen space. but it was very cheap and close to campus, so i guess it just depends on what you're willing to put up with. i wouldn't trust management though. tldr: cockroaches, health hazards, and shady management make a horrible combo. it may be better now though.","{'background': ['i, however, am poor']}",No struggles found,,3

385,"much the same as clachan as far as maintenance and security deposits. my friend lived with them for two years. the apartment below her caught fire and they told her that she couldn't move or have her security deposit, even though the fire marshal condemned that wing of the building. another friend just moved out of one of their buildings on franklin wherein her shower ceiling fell down and leaked rusty water into her bathroom for three months before they fixed it, among other horrible things. she also got $0 of her deposit back. just be thorough before you sign a lease. river city rentals or whatever it's called is much the same. but that's what you get when you live in a college area- they are going to try to take advantage of you. just know your rights. i recommend legend properties (who i live with now and next year), though they are a bit pricey, more for young professionals than students.","{'background': [""just be thorough before you sign a lease. river city rentals or whatever it's called is much the same. but that's what you get when you live in a college area- they are going to try to take advantage of you. just know your rights. i recommend legend properties (who i live with now and next year), though they are a bit pricey, more for young professionals than students.""]}","['maintenance', 'security deposits', 'fire', 'showers falling down', 'rusty water', 'deposit not returned', 'taking advantage of students', 'knowing rights', 'Legend Properties']",,3
